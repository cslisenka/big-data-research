RHONE-POULENC PLANS DRUG RESEARCH SPENDING

(Rhone Poulenc Pharma Inc) said it plans to spend 29 mln dlrs over the next five years for research and development in Canada. It said the investment depends upon passage of a federal government bill which proposes greater protection for holders of drug patents.     The company said it will spend 7.9 mln dlrs to upgrade its Montreal operations.     It said the new patent law would give drug companies  reasonable protection from generic drug copying of new compounds.  Reuter &#3;
