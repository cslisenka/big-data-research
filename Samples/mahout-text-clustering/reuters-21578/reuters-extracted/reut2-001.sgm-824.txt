DOME<DMP> DEBT PLAN LIKELY CIRCULATED NEXT WEEK

Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to reschedule debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely be detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesday next week, a company spokesman said.     Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told Reuters in response to an inquiry.     Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3 billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to implement the debt plan now under negotiation.     Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following release of the plan to lenders.     Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle from creditors prior to June 30.     The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with cash flow generated by assets backing the loans.     Annesley also said there was no change in the status of legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.     Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss franc denominated debt in default.     Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.     Dome Petroleum's 1986 fourth quarter and year earnings will likely be reported at the end of March, he also said.  Reuter &#3;
