MOBIL <MOB> UNIT TO PRODUCE FOOD PACKAGING

Mobil Corp's Mobil Chemical Co's subsidiary, the world's largest producer of disposable plastic products, said it will enter the food packaging market.     Mobil said it will begin making clear container food packaging for supermarkets and institutions in March and will sharply raise production in the fall to an annual rate of more than 20 mln pounds of finished products.     It said industry demand for the products is projected to rise 15 pct annually over the next five years, and it is prepared to boost production substantially with future plant additions.     Mobil's Chemical's Plastic Packaging Division, which will make and sell the new product line, operates nine plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.     It also said the clear containers, seen in packaging for cookies, candy and bakery trays, grocery sald bar items, and other items, will be made from oriented polystyrene at the company's Canandiagua, N.Y., plant.
