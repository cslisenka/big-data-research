SWISS PAVING WAY TO INDEX FUTURES, OPTIONS

Switzerland expects to launch fully computerized trading of financial futures and options in the near future, a senior Swiss official said.     Alexis Lautenberg, minister for economic and financial services at the Department of Foreign Affairs, said a stock index based on issues traded on the three major Swiss exchanges is expected to be completed this month, marking "an important step towards the introduction of an option market and index futures."     Trading of options will begin next year "with more than a dozen of the most actively traded shares ... and non-voting equities," he told the Futures Industry Association.     The Swiss envision requiring dealers to handle transactions on the computerized system and market makers to trade specific equities, Lautenberg said.     The Swiss official also said there would be limits on the positions and exercise of option rights and that firms would have to comply with minimum capital requirements under Swiss banking law.     He also said "intensive consultations" were under way with a view toward allowing profits earned from traded options and financial futures to be considered capital gains.     "It would follow that only when a buyer would exercise his option right by realizing a physical transaction would the stamp duty, or securities tax, be levied," Lautenberg said.  Reuter &#3;
