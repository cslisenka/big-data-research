KOEHLER RESIGNS AFTER ONE-WEEK AS REAGAN AIDE

White House communications director John Koehler resigned after just one week in the job, saying President Reagans' new chief of staff Howard Baker had a right to appoint his own team.     Koehler was hired to replace Patrick Buchanan as Reagan's communications chief a few days before Donald Regan quit as the president's top aide.     "I don't feel I've been jerked around ... I recognize that Senator Baker must have people around him for the next 22 months that he's known for a long time, that he understands, that he's comfortable with and who are comfortable with him," said Koehler during an appearance in the White House press room.
