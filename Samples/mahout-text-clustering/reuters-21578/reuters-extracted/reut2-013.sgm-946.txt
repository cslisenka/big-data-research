UNISYS <UIS> OFFERS NEW MAINFRAME MODELS

Unisys Corp said it is offering eight new models of its A15 large-scale mainframe computer.     The new models improve the overall system performance by an average 20 pct, the computer maker said.     Memory capacity on four of the models is doubled, and is increased by 50 pct on the A12 mainframe.     Unisys said prices for the new models range from 2.9 mln dlrs for the single processor A-15FX to 8.4 mln dlrs for an A-15NX, which has four processors.     The new computer systems, which encorporate the "Master Control Program/Advanced Systems" operating system, will compete with other large mainframes, including International Business Machines Corp's <IBM> IBM 3090, Unisys said.     Unisys' A-12 computer is a less powerful, smaller version of the A-15.     The A-12 is a "lower-end model, almost an entry-level machine," said a Unisys spokesman.     The price of the machine starts at 1.4 mln dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
