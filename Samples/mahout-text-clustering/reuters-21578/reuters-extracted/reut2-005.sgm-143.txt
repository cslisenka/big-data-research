SPAIN SETS BANK PROVISIONS FOR HIGH-RISK BORROWERS

The Bank of Spain said banks must make provisions amounting to at least 25 pct of outstanding loans to countries deemed to be high-risk borrowers.     The measure was included in a package of circulars approved by governors of the central bank yesterday.     The bank said it was retaining a complex system for calculating the proportion of loans which must be covered by special provisions but added that sudden shifts in the situation of borrowers had made it advisable to set a minimum level of 25 pct for such provisions.     The bank said another measure instructs banks and financial institutions to begin setting aside provisions for future pension obligations.     Banks were obliged last year to ensure that they had made sufficient provisions for current pension obligations and a new circular sets a maximum time limit of five years to cover future obligations.
