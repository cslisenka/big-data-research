S/P MAY UPGRADE COMPUTER ASSOC <CA>, UCCEL <UCE>

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may upgrade 100 mln dlrs of B-plus subordinated debt of Computer Associates International Inc and 13 mln dlrs of B-minus subordinated debt of UCCEL Corp.     S and P cited a merger agreement between the two companies which it believes will improve both firms' market positions as well as complement each other's products and distribution.     But S and P pointed out that duplicate product lines could raise marketing difficulties and restrict sales.     The agency will study improvements in the financial condition and competitive position of the merged entity.  Reuter &#3;
