STREET FIRMS TAKE LOSSES, BUT REAFFIRM STRENGTH

Senior officers at major Wall Street firms said they've been suffering heavy trading losses during the market's decline, but stressed their firms are liquid enough to withstand the battering.     "We certainly lost money in our trading departments yesterday and today and in effect gave back a small part of the year's profits," said Robert E. Linton, chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "But the firm is in good shape. We're very liquid, although we're going to show some red ink for a short time."     Rumors of collapses at major U.S. securities firms swept the world's financial markets since the U.S. stock market began its record decline Monday.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 508 Monday to 1738, erasing the entire gain of the past year. Tuesday's trading was also volatile on volume of more than 614 mln shares. Stocks were mostly lower, but the Dow indicator recovered 102 points to a preliminary closing figure of 1841.     "There are all kinds of rumors being circulated, by bears I guess, about firms having problems," said Salomon Inc Chairman John Gutfreund.  Reuter &#3;
