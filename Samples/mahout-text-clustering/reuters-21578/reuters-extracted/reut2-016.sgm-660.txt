CORE-MARK <CMK.TO> SEES PROBLEM CORRECTION

Core-Mark International Inc said it was vigorously addressing its problems and would correct them in the near term.     The packaged goods distributor said that its statement followed "a number of apparently confusing statements concerning the company that may have given rise to uncertainty as to the company's current operative condition and future."     Core-Mark previously said that former chief executive D.E. Gillespie resigned due to family problems and declining health, and added that negotiations for sale of his majority stake to two unnamed investor groups were a growing possibility.     Core-Mark's interim chief executive Anthony Regensburg said the sudden earnings deterioration in late fourth quarter "took everyone by surprise and directors along with management are urgently addressing these problems.     "Speculation as to the company's future has been less than helpful and has provoked and heightened anxieties and diverted management's time and attention to address them," Regensburg said in a statement.
