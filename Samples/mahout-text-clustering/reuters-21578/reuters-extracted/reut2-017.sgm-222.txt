Taiwan's unemployment rate fell to 2.03 pct of the labour force in March from 2.37 pct in February and 2.79 pct in March 1986, the government statistics department said.     A department official said the decline was due to rising employment in the manufacturing sector, including textiles and footwear.     The unemployed totalled 163,000 in March against 193,000 in February and 216,000 in March 1986.
