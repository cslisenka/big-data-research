CANADA POST WORKERS REJECT LATEST OFFER

Canadian letter carriers today rejected a new contract offer from Canada Post as the strike spread to Toronto where half the nation's mail is sorted.     The Letter Carriers Union said the new offer presented June 18 contained the same demands for concessions the union had already refused.     The union members walked out in other Ontario cities today but returned to work in Atlantic Canada, parts of Quebec, Edmonton, and Victoria. Negotiators were scheduled to resume bargaining today but were not expected to reach an agreement to end the four-day-old strike.  Reuter &#3;
