EC STATES ATTACK PLAN TO PENALISE FARMERS

EC agriculture ministers attacked plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that cereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said.     They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing spending on the cereals regime.     The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises above 155 mln tonnes.     The sources said several ministers complained that changing price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage the financial security of farmers.     But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security regardless of market circumstances.     The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need for some output ceilings. However, the French and Dutch ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of cereal crops, rather than for cereals alone.     The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings for individual countries with excess production being paid for from national exchequers, but received no support for this idea.     British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he detected more support for his position against the penalties on farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility levies.     He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for farmers could help in this direction.  Reuter &#3;
