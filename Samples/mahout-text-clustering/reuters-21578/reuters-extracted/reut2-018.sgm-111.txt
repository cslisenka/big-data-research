TANDY <TAN> DEBT MAY BE UPGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may upgrade Tandy Corp's 175 mln dlrs of long-term debt.     The agency said the review would focus on Tandy's capacity to sustain its current earnings recovery and on the company's ability to further improve its cash flow performance by greater operating efficiencies.     Moody's said it would also evaluate Tandy's capital structure. That structure has changed significantly as a result of the retirement of about 250 mln dlrs of debt in the past year. Under review are Tandy's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1 subordinated debt.  Reuter &#3;
