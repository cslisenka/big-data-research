Goodman Fielder U.K. Plc is issuing a 75 mln stg convertible eurobond due July 4, 1997 with an indicated coupon of five to 5-1/4 pct and par pricing, lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd said.     The issue is guaranteed by Goodman Fielder Ltd and final terms will be set on, or before, June 5.
