BALDRIGE WILL NOT OBJECT TO COMPUTERS FOR IRAN

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he would not object to the sale of computers to Iran because the technology was that of U.S.-designed personal computers developed ten years ago.     "We have no reason not to ship it," Baldrige told reporters after a Senate Banking Committee hearing on export controls.     Baldrige said the Defense Department's objection that the computers would be used in newspaper production was not a reason to bar the granting of an export license. "This is not a reason for denying it on foreign policy grounds," he said.  Reuter &#3;
