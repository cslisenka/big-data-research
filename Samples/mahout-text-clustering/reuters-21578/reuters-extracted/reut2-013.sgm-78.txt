UNITED WATER <UWR> UNIT RATE CUT APPROVED

United Water Resources Inc's Hackensack Water Co subsidiary said the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has authorized a 5.9 pct cut in its water rates.     The company said the cut, which is effective today, is expected to reduce its revenues by 5.2 mln dlrs a year.     The company also said it probably will not need to seek additionalk rate adjustments until the end of 1987. It applied in January for a decrease of about 2.3 mln dlrs in annual revenues, equal to about three pct. This was adjusted to reflect increased water use, and lower power costs and taxes.
