SWISSAIR ORDERS SIX MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-11 JETS

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> said it was confirming six orders for the new MD-11 long-haul jet of McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> and had taken options for a further 12 planes.     The order, which involved rejecting the A-340 plane being built by the European Airbus consortium, is to replace the airline's fleet of DC-10 aircraft in the early 1990s.     Swissair said in December it was giving the MD-11 "primary" consideration, and had reserved six places for delivery, pending a final order.  REUTER &#3;
