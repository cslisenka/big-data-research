U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY SAYS NO BRAZIL CRISIS

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said he did not believe Brazil was currently in a crisis because of its debt situation and hoped the country would resolve its differences with commerical banks through direct negotiations.     Answering questions before a House appropriations subcommittee, Baker told a questioner "I disagree with your crisis characterization" regarding Brazil.     He said that while the U.S. Treasury regretted Brazil's interest payment moratorium on commercial bank debt, "We hope and believe they'll resolve this through direct negotiations (with the banks)."     Baker said the financial community around the world believes it is imperative that Brazil comes up with a comprehensive program to adjust its economy.     In other comments on foreign debt, Baker said that the situation has improved since mid-1982 because the banks are in much better shape and have rebuilt reserves.     He also noted interest rates are considerably lower today than they were when the crisis broke out and the rate of increase in debt has slowed considerably.     In addition, Baker noted a number of debtors are making reasonably good economic progress, and he cited Mexico in particular.  Reuter &#3;
