JUDGE REDUCES JURY AWARD TO COASTAL <CGP>

Coastal Corp said a federal district court judge has upheld a trial jury's judgment against a Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> subsidiary but reduced the amount awarded a Coastal subsidiary to 412 mln dlrs from 549 mln dlrs.     The company said Judge Clarence A. Brimmer denied all post-trial motions by Occidental's Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America but did eliminate the trebling of a portion of the damages for future lost profits and part of the damages for interference with a contract awarded by the jury in the antitrust case last October.         An Occidental spokesman said the company has previously said it will take the case to the federal appeals court which has previously upheld the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations Natural Gas Pipeline was following in its dealings with Coastal's Colorado Interstate pipeline subsidiary and Union Pacific Corp <UNP> Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary.
