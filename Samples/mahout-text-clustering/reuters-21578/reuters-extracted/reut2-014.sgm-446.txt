CBT CORN FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER ON FIRM NOTE

CBT corn futures closed on or near the highs, up 1-1/4 to three cents per bushel, with May settling at 1.59-1/2 dlrs after posting a 1-1/2 cent range.     Slow country movement, yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to about three times last year's weekly inspections, plus the outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline in the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.     Many traders said they were mystified why Drexel Burnham was such an aggressive buyer today in new crop December.     Farmers will probably plant as many acres as allowed under the government programs and near-record yields must be assumed at this time because they will aggressively apply fertilizer to prime yielding acres, one commercial trader noted.
