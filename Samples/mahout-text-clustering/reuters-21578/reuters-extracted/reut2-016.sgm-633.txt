MORTON THIOKOL <MTI> WANTS PAPERS MADE PUBLIC

Lawyers for Morton Thiokol Inc asked a federal judge to unseal all papers filed in court here in connection with a lawsuit against it by a former employee.     U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held a hearing this morning on the company's request but took no immediate action, according to a clerk.     The company's motion was opposed by lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice.     The lawsuit filed by the former employee, engineer Roger Boisjoly, alleged criminal responsibility by Thiokol in the deaths of the seven Challenger astronauts in January 1986.     Justice Department sources told Reuters earlier this month that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a criminal investigation of Thiokol, which made the booster rocket blamed for the loss of the Challenger space shuttle.     The sources said the probe stemmed from the suit by Boisjoly, who is now on medical disability.     Boisjoly is seeking damages from the company for allegedly defaming his professional reputation by transferring him to a less important job after he testified to a presidential commission about the Challenger explosion.
