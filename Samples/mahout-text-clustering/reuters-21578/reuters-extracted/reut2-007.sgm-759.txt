COMEX CONSIDERING NEW FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Commodity Exchange Inc, COMEX, is researching the possibility of offering futures contracts on foreign currency swaps and Ginnie Mae repurchase agreements, a COMEX consultant said.     Kurt Dew, president of Risk Analysis Systems, said the idea was on the drawing board at the staff level and not near realization.     Dew said the contracts would be logical successors to two contracts already proposed by the exchange -- futures on interest rate swaps and on Treasury repurchase agreements, or repos.     Regulations recently proposed by federal bank regulators could enhance the attractiveness of futures contracts on currency swaps, he said.     Those regulations would require banks to allocate a certain share of its capital to currency swaps, Dew said. Futures on currency swaps would not require capital allocation.     A futures market in Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) repos would help investors outside the circle of primary dealers get the best possible price, Dew said.     Dew emphasized that the COMEX board had not yet considered the contracts.  Reuter &#3;
