SOVIETS HAVE TESTED SS-18 MISSILE - WEINBERGER

U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the Soviet Union continues to grow in military strength and has tested its SS-18 intermediate-range missile.     It was a "successful test so far as we know, and the next one of course is the follow-on to the SS-20," Weinberger told interviewers on the CNN television network.     "They finished deploying the SS-20 some time last year. They are all ready well advanced on its follow-on. They never stop. That"s the lesson."     "They continue to grow in all aspects: conventional, land, sea, air and nuclear," he said of Soviet military strength.  REUTER &#3;
