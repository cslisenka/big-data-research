U.S. ARMS NEGOTIATOR SAID TO HAVE HEART ATTACK

U.S. arms negotiator Max Kampelman suffered a mild heart attack, an aide said.     Nancy Tackett, Kampleman's staff assistant, told Reuters Kampelman was doing well and was expected to leave George Washington Hospital in about a week.     "A full recovery is expected," she said.     Kampelman did not feel well yesterday and may have sufffered the heart attack then, Tackett said. He had a regularly-scheduled physical this morning and entered the hospital after that, on his doctor's advice, she said.       A hospital spokesman confirmed that Kampelman was a patient in the coronary care unit.   Reuter &#3;
