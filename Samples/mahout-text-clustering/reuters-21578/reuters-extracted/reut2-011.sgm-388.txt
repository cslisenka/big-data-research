U.S. ADVISER SAID DEAD IN SALVADOR RAID

At least 40 soldiers and guerrillas including a U.S. military adviser died today in a major battle in northern El Salvador, military sources said.     The sources said 30 guerrillas and 12 government soldiers were killed when up to 800 leftwing guerrillas attacked the El Paraiso base of the Fourth Infantry Brigade in the province of Chalatenango, about 35 miles north of San Salvador.     A U.S. embassy spokesman confirmed that a U.S. adviser was among the dead.      The one-hour battle involved some of the heaviest fighting for several years, the sources said.   Reuter &#3;
