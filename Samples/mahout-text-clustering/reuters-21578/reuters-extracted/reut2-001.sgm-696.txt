U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY FORM CONSORTIUM

A consortium of electrics industry firms to challenge Japan's presence in the global semiconductor market was announced by the Semiconductor Industry Association.     The initiative will be funded by U.S. manufacturers to develop the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technologies, the association said at a news conference.     Government participation and financial support will also be sought for the consortium called SEMATECH, for "semiconductor manufacturing technology."      "We can continue to sit back and watch the Japanese target and assualt yet another critical U.S. industry. Or we can get in gear and do what is necessary to repell this attack," said Irwin Federman, chief executive officer of Monolithic Memories Inc.

The plan was for SEMATECH to establish a facility at various manufacturers and equipment suppliers to pioneer advanced manufacturing techniques for semiconductors. REUTER... &#3;
