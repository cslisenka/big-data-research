BOFORS MANAGING DIRECTOR RESIGNS

Martin Ardbo, managing director of <AB Bofors>, which is at the centre of a police inquiry into illegal arms shipments to Iran, has resigned, the company said.     Ardbo was Bofors marketing head at the time peace groups say the company supplied arms to countries Sweden had blacklisted.     Ardbo was stepping down from his post at Bofors but would continue to work for the parent company, Bofors said in a statement. "For the past two years, an inquiry into alleged illegal arms exports has been carried out at Bofors. Arbo has decided that it would be unsuitable if he continued to represent the company," the statement said. It gave no further details.  REUTER &#3;
