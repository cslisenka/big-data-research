BAKER SAYS U.S. OPPOSES SOVIET BANK MEMBERSHIP

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.     Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the IMF."     Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified and unconditional."     The secretary observed that he has written to congressman Jack Kemp, a New York Republican who is also a presidential contender, outlining the U.S. position.     Baker was responding to a questioner who noted that World Bank President Barber Conable has in the past suggested future Soviet membership could take place.     Ever since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev suggested Soviet membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- which was also rejected -- there has been speculation Moscow was interested in joining the international institutions.
