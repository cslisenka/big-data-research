NIGERIA REVERSES POLICY, RESTORES MINIMUM WAGE

Nigeria's military government retreated in the face of hostile public opinion and restored the minimum wage of 125 naira (about 32 dlrs) a month.     It revoked an order made only last December which exempted companies with fewer than 500 employees -- the vast majority -- from paying the minimum wage.     Labour Minister Brigadier Ike Nwachukwu, announcing the decision in Lagos today, said it was made out of respect for public opinion and to maintain industrial harmony.     Nwachukwu said the thinking behind the exemption was in line with Nigeria's far-reaching structural adjustment program and the measure was intended to promote small-scale industry and agriculture.
