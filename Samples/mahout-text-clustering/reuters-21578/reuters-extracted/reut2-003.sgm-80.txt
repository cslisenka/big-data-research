BAILIFF APPOINTED TO SEEK OUT FERMENTA FOUNDER

A Stockholm court today appointed a bailiff to find the founder of troubled Swedish biotech group Fermenta AB <FRMS.ST>, who is being sued for 30 million crowns by a disgruntled shareholder.     The court heard that Refaat el-Sayed, sacked from the Fermenta board after losing his principal shareholding to creditors, had failed to reply to an official court notice about the action which was sent to him two weeks ago.     The bailiff was appointed to find el-Sayed and gain an official response to the court notice within the next fortnight.  Reuter &#3;
