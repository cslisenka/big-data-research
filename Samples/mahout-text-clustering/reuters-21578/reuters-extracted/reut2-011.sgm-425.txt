MOZAMBIQUE SEEKS ADDITIONAL 160 MLN DLRS IN AID

Mozambique appealed for an additional 160 mln dlrs in emergency humanitarian aid to help the country through a severe economic crisis.     Prime Minister Mario Machungo told a news conference several countries -- notably the U.S., Britain and Italy -- had already made pledges towards this new appeal.     The U.S. offered grain amounting to a third of the nation's annual consumption, Britain offered eight mln stg and Italy was expected to offer 30 to 35 mln dlrs, he said.     The country's "extremely severe economic crisis" stemmed from continued fighting with "armed bandits" -- a euphemism for anti-government guerrillas -- and a series of floods which have destroyed crops, Machungo said.     An estimated four million people require emergency care.  Reuter &#3;
