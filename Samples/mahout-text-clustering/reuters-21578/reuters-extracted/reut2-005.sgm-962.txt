REAGAN TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE THURSDAY

President Reagan, ending four months of semi-isolation from the press, will hold a televised news conference on Thursday, the White House said.     Reagan is certain to be questioned extensively at the 2000 EST/0100 gmt session about the secret sale of arms to Iran and skimming of profits to aid U.S.-backed "contra" rebels in Nicaragua.     During his last news conference on November 19, 1986 -- six days before the fund diversion came to light -- Reagan strongly defended the clandestine arms operation.     During that session, the president also denied any third country involvement in the Iran initiative even though it was already known that Israel had played a key role in the arms shipments. The White House was forced to issue a correction following the news conference.     Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter with reporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his job approval rating in various public opinion polls.     Since the November 19 news conference, Reagan --who maintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- has revised his position on his covert Iran policy.  Reuter &#3;
