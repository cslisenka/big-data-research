FARMERS RENEW PROTESTS IN SPAIN

Hundreds of farmers brought Madrid's traffic to a standstill with their tractors in the latest protest to demand a better deal from the European Community (EC) and more government subsidies to face up to EC competition.     Farmers said they had planned to bring their cows with them but police had prevented their entry into the capital.     In the south, striking shipyard workers clashed with police in the port of Cadiz in what has become a regular weekly protest against job layoffs at the state-owned Astilleros Espanoles. The workers locked themselves in the factory and traded stones for tear gas, police said.  Reuter &#3;
