JAPAN MACHINERY ORDERS FALL IN APRIL

Japan's private sector machinery orders, excluding shipbuilding, fell 10.4 pct in April from March to a seasonally adjusted 663.8 billion yen, after rising 17.6 pct in March, the government's Economic Planning Agency said.     April orders rose 2.0 pct from a year earlier after a 22.6 pct year-on-year rise in March, an agency spokesman told Reuters.     Seasonally adjusted private sector orders, excluding those for shipbuilding and electric power firms, fell 7.5 pct in April from March to 517.4 billion yen, after a 5.7 pct rise in March from February.     April orders fell 1.3 pct from a year earlier after being unchanged in March.     The April drop was due mainly to a 12.9 pct decrease in orders from machine tool industries and a 15.3 pct drop in orders from car makers, the spokesman said.  REUTER &#3;
