JAPANESE CAPITAL SPENDING GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW

Japanese private sector investment in plant and equipment is expected to grow a real 0.9 pct in 1987, after an estimated 5.5 pct rise last year, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd said.     It said its survey of 1,169 companies at the end of February showed that manufacturing industry investment will decline eight pct this year, while non-manufacturing will increase 5.7 pct. It did not provide figures for 1986.     The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturing investment on the uncertain outlook for demand in those industries.     The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking and shipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance and repair costs for their facilities and equipment.     In non-manufacturing industry, growth in investment is expected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retail store area, 12.4 pct, as new department stores and supermarkets are built and old ones are remodelled.     The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporate investment that would help restructure the Japanese economy and urged government deregulation and other action to offset this.
