REAGAN URGES REVISION OF HIGH TECH EXPORT LIMITS

President Reagan has sent Congress proposals to streamline high-tech export control procedures, the White House said.     "These proposals are part of the president's energetic program to enhance America's competitiveness in the world economy," it said in a written statement.     It said the proposals included exempting from license requirements a number of low technology items and allowing foreign manufacturers to re-export U.S. parts and components up to a certain level without U.S. government re-export authorization.
