INVESTOR EYES BETHLEHEM STEEL <BS> BOARD SEAT

Joseph Harrosh, a Fremont, Calif., investor with a 5.6 pct in Bethlehem Steel Corp preferred stock, said he intends to seek at least one of two board seats which may open should Bethlehem delay dividend payments.     In a handwritten filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harrosh said he would seek the board seat if Betheleham Steel falls six quarters behind in its dividend payments to preferred holders.     A six-quarter dividend delay would open two board seats which would be filled by preferred holders.     Harrosh reported he has 139,300 shares of Bethlehem's five dlr cumulative convertible preferred stock.  Reuter &#3;
