BENETTON SEES HIGHER PROFIT, SALES IN 1987

Italian fashion conglomerate Benetton Group Spa <BTOM.MI> expects its net profit to rise to around 135 billion lire in 1987 from 113 billion the year before, Aldo Palmeri, managing director of Benetton Group, said.     Palmeri told a presentation here that sales should increase to between 1,280 and 1,300 billion lire in 1987 from 1,079 billion in 1986, of which foreign sales were expected to take up 850 billion lire.     Benetton finance director Carlo Gilardi said the company was planning to diversify further into the financial services sector and would also expand into the shoe business.     Benetton expanded into financial services mainly to speed up the development of its own systems, Gilardi said. Benetton has 400 sub-contractors and 600 distributor companies which created a demand for such services. "But we do not plan to abandon our traditional business," Gilardi said.     Benetton plans to expand further outside Italy, especially in the Far East. Talks are under way over a possible joint venture with the Soviet Union and with South Korea.     Palmeri said Benetton plans to list its shares in Frankfurt, London, New York and Tokyo as part of its global expansion but gave no dates when the listings would take place.  Reuter &#3;
