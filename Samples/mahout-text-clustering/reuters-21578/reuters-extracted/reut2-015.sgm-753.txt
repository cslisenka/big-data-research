YOUNG AND RUBICAM IS DEFENDENT IN ATT <T> SUIT

<Worldwide 800 Services Inc>, whose Service 800 unit recently filed a lawsuit against American Telephone and Telegraph Co for false advertising and anti-competitive practices, said it has named <Young and Rubicam>, an advertising firm, as a defendent in the case.     Worldwide said Young and Rubicam designed and placed the ATT advertisements in question.     The amended complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, seeks injuctive relief damages, the company said.     The suit charges Young and Rubicam with misrepresenting ATT's involvement in the toll-free international dialing service network through a series of false and misleading advertisements.
