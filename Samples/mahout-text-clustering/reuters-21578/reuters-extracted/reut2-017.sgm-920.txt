NATIONALE-NEDERLANDEN EXPECTS TO MATCH 1986 PROFIT

Nationale-Nederlanden NV <NTNN.AS>, the largest Dutch insurance company, reported a four-pct rise in first quarter profits. The announcement represented a break with the company's past practice of giving annual results only.     The company said it expects its 1987 net profit will at least equal the 1986 figure of 635.5 guilders.     Nationale-Nederlanden said the lower exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar, Australian dollar and sterling had brought the increase in the quarter's net profit down from 6.3 pct.     Premium income from damage and life insurances pushed turnover in the Netherlands up by eight pct.  reuter &#3;
