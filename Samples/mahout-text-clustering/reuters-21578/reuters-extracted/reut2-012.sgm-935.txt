U.S. SENATE DEFEATS MOVE TO CUT MEXICO AID

The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate sided with President Reagan and defeated an attempt to cut U.S. aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperate fully with the American war against drugs.     A day after the Senate trounced Reagan's attempt to sustain a veto of a major highway bill, a bipartisan majority gave him a victory by shelving on a 49 to 38 vote a measure to halve assistance given Mexico.     Two companion measures also were expected to be defeated, to halve aid to Panama and the Bahamas.     The fight was considered more symbolic than having significant impact, since Mexico this year is receiving a relatively small 15.7 mln dlrs in assistance. But critics said cutting the aid would hurt U.S.-Mexico relations.  Reuter &#3;
