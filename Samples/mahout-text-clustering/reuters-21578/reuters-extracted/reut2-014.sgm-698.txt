U.S. STOCK INDEX FUTURES PLUMMET IN LATE TRADE

U.S. stock index futures dropped in  active late afternoon trade and closed near daily lows.     The selloff followed an early rally that had sent June S and P 500s to a new contract high of 306.10. Arbitrage buy programs were triggered when the June S and P reached a 3.20 point premium over the spot index, traders said.     However, weakness in the bond market in afternoon trade sparked selling in June S and Ps, sending the nearby contract to a discount which triggered the unwinding of buy programs, traders said. June S and Ps fell through chart support at 296.00 which also sparked technical selling.     Value Line futures closed down 6.85 to 7.00, S and P 500 futures fell 7.65 to 7.85, NYSE futures dropped 4.60, and MMI futures ended 10.65 to 11.00 points lower.   Reuter &#3;
