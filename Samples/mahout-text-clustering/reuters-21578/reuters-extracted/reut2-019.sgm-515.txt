JAPAN TO HELP U.S. ON ANTI-SUBMARINE DEFENCES

Japan has agreed to help the United States strengthen anti-submarine defences after illegal high-technology Japanese exports significantly damaged mutual security, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.     Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanese machines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harder to detect had been a serious blow. But he said he was encouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>, for the illegal exports, and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances that action would be taken to keep it from happening again.     The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting to Communist countries for a year and said it intends to strengthen and expand its export control system.     Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program.     In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara, he said, he made a pitch for American companies seeking to build Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's.     "I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans to increase Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believe American aircraft can do this," he said. The Japanese industry argues it should develop the fighter plane on its own.  REUTER &#3;
