SALOMON INC <SB> SAID IT RECEIVED SUBPOENA

Salomon Inc's Salomon Brothers unit said the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed its records with respect to Fireman's Fund Corp, American Express Co, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, Jefferies and Co and others.     Salomon brothers co-managed a public offering by American Express of Fireman's Fund securities. Salomon said American Express' Shearson subsidiary was the lead manager and ran the books for the offering.     Shearson and American Express were both subpoenaed for documents on certain transactions.     American Express earlier said it was subpoenaed on transactions involving securities of American Express and Fireman's Fund, and Shearson was subpoenaed for documents on transactions with Jefferies and Co and others.     Salomon co-managed the Fireman's Fund offering in 1986. Salomon said it intends to comply with the subpoena and cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said it was unaware of the SEC investigation prior to yesterday.     Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies and Co, said he would plead guilty to two felony counts for securities law violations.     A Salomon Brothers official said no individuals at the firm were subpoenaed. An American Express spokesman did not return phone calls.  Reuter &#3;
