PEPSICO <PEP> NEW JERSEY BOTTLING UNIT ON STRIKE

The New Jersey operations of Pepsico Inc's Pepsicola Bottling Group in the New York metropolitan area have been struck by Teamsters Union Local 125, a Pepsico spokesman said.     He said the company has hired temporary drivers to cover deliveries from the struck warehouses in West Caldwell, North Brunswick, Moonachie and South Carney.     Also struck were the company's manufacturing operations at Teeterboro and its food service operations at Hasbrouck Heights, the spokesman added.     The Pepsico spokesman said the company's contract with the union expirted at 2400 EDT yesterday.     He said the company reached a tentative agreement with the union Friday after five weeks of negotiations which was rejected by the rank and file in a vote Saturday.  Reuter &#3;
