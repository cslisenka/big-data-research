EXIMBANK LOAN CEILING SET

President Reagan set the Export-Import Bank's direct loan ceiling in fiscal year 1987 at 800 mln dlrs, a decrease of 100 mln dlrs.     In a letter to Congress, Reagan also said he was not seeking any additional legislation to rescind any authority of the bank, which aids U.S. exports.     Reagan said he had concluded that the statutory 1987 limit for Eximbank loan guarantee commitments should not be changed, noting that "continued growth in the U.S. economy and global recovery could create unexpected demand for guarantees and insurance."
