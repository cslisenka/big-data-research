NBC SAYS PROGRAMMING NOT AFFECTED BY STRIKE

National Broadcasting Co, a unit of General Electric Co <GE>, said programming has not been affected by a strike which began just after midnight June 28.     "Right now things are running very smoothly," said NBC spokeswoman McClaine Ramsey.     The strike by members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees, representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000 workers, began after the network imposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable. The union said its main objection to the contract was that it permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.     Ramsey said managers had been trained to replace the roles of many of the producers, news writers, editors and technicians who walked off the job. She said no reductions in programming, much of which is summer re-run schedule, were expected.     NABET executive board member Bill Freeh said many people, some brought in from foreign news bureaus, had crossed picket lines set up at NBC television stations and bureaus.  Reuter &#3;
