BANKAMERICA <BAC> TO SECURITIZE CREDIT CARDS

BankAmerica Corp's Bank of America unit said it will offer 300 mln dlrs in certificates representing interests in a pool of receivables selected from its California Classic Visa credit card accounts.     The certificate rate is 8.2 pct. The offering price to the public is 99.89 dlrs, resulting in a yield to certificate holdes of 8.21 pct.     The certificates have a provisional rating of Aaa by Moody's Investors Service and are backed by a 30-mln-dlr lettter of credit by Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, BankAmerica said.     The offering will be co-managed by Salomon Brothers Inc and the bank.     "Selling these loans provides a cost-effective source of medium-term funds and allows the bank to leverage its existing capital base across a broad range of activities," said Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Frank Newman.     Bank of America said it will continue to service the loans and maintain customer relationships, while the proceeds of the offering can be used to fund new loans.     BankAmerica said it pioneered securitization in 1977 with home loans sold as mortgage pass-through certificates.  Reuter &#3;
