DATA GENERAL <DGN> OFFERS NEW NETWORK PRODUCTS

Data General Corp said it introduced several new hardware and software products that link International Business Machines Corp <IBM> and IBM-compatible personal computers into mainframe and minicomputer systems.     Data General said the products include three local area networks that conform to industry standards. It said it is now offering a Starlan network, which was originally introduced by American telephone and Telegraph Co <t>, a thin Ethernet and a PC interface for the standard Ethernet.         In addition, Data General said it will offer several software packages for PC networks, including MS Net, a product developed by Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> that allows PCs to share printers, data files and other peripherals.     The company said it also introduced a PC version of its popular CEO office automation software.     Data General said the new products allow computer users to divide work among a collection of PCs and larger computers.         "Data General is the first vendor to offer three different local area networks for personal computer integration," said Colin Crook, senior vice president of the company's communications systems group.     "We're really giving users freedom of choice with industry standard products," added J. David Lyons, vice president of group marketing.     In addition to the new products, which were expected, Data General announced a joint product development agreement with <Gold Hill Computers>, a Cambridge, Mass.,-based artificial intelligence software company.         The company also announced the formation of a new network services group that will help customers plan and design computer networks.     The group will also provide service and maintenance for Data General and other vendors' equipment, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
