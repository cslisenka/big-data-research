JAPAN DOCK STRIKE TO CONTINUE OVER WEEKEND

A strike by Japanese dockworkers will continue over the weekend as no breakthrough is in sight, a Japan Harbour Transportation Association spokesman said.     The association has not yet agreed on a schedule for preliminary negotiations with the National Council of Harbour Workers Unions, because the council insisted on talks with shippers as well as dock management, he said.     The strike, which began on Tuesday, halted container movements to points inside Japan from the ports of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Kitakyushu, Shimizu, Yokkaichi and Hakata.  Reuter &#3;
