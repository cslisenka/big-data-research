G-7 OFFICIALS TO MEET IN SARDINIA THIS WEEK

Representatives of the Group of Seven will meet in the Sardinian resort of Porto Cervo from April 30 to May 2 to discuss the agenda for the group's Venice summit in June, sources close to the Italian Foreign Ministry said.     The sources said the meeting would be informal and attended by the personal representatives of G-7 leaders.     The sources did not comment on reports from Osaka that deputy finance ministers would attend the Porto Cervo meeting, and said there would be a complete information blackout on the gathering.     The sources had no comment on statements by Japanese officials in Osaka yesterday that the falling dollar would be among topics discussed.     The Japanese officials had said the meeting, while focusing on longer-term issues, would provide senior government officials with their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the dollar.
