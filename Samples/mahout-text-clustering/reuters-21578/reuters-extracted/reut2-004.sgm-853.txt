ITALIAN BUSINESS CONCERNED OVER POLITICAL CRISIS

Italian Prime Minister designate Giulio Andreotti expressed cautious optimism about his chances of forming a government, amid concern by industrialists that a lengthy political crisis could cause economic damage.     Andreotti today wound up his first round of political consultations aimed at finding a way out of the crisis.     His Christian Democrats and the Socialists of outgoing premier Bettino Craxi, whose row caused last week's collapse of the five-party coalition, remained deeply divided.     Andreotti said he would spend the weekend considering the situation before a second round of consultations next week.     Meanwhile Italy's top industrialists expressed concern that a long drawn-out crisis, or continuing squabbling between the five coalition partners, could jeopardise the major economic progress made in three-and-a-half stable years under Craxi.     Luigi Lucchini, president of the employers organisation Confindustria said in a speech yesterday, "What is certain is that a precarious political situation is damaging to the economy, to the objectives of companies, to competitivity."     His remarks were supported by Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli, who said in a radio interview that he hoped for a reconstruction of the coalition.  REUTER &#3;
