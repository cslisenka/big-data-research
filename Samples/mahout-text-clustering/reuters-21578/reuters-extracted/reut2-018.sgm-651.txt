GREAT WESTERN <GWF> OFFERS 2.5 MLN COMMON SHARES

Great Western Financial Corp said it is offering 2,513,200 common shares at a price of 20.625 dlrs per share.     The company said the shares are being offered in connection with the conversion of SunPoint Savings Bank FSB of Lake Worth Fla to stock from mutual form and its simultaneous merger into Great Western Bank, a federal savings bank owned by Great Western Financial.     Great Western Bank said it has received Federal Home Loan Bank Board approval to acquire SunPoint Savings, which has assets of about 730 mln dlrs.         Great Western noted the conversion merger recently won the approval of 94 pct of SunPoint's members -- a group comprising the depositors and borrowers of that company. The merger is expected to be completed by June 25.     Great Western said depositors and employees of SunPoint will purchase 56,500 shares of Great Western's common at the same price in a subscription offering. Proceeds of both the public and subscription offerings will be contributed to Great Western Bank and used in its lending operations.     The offering will be underwritten by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Goldman Sachs and Co.  Reuter &#3;
