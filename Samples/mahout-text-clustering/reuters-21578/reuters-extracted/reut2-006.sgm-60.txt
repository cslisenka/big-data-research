BAKER SAYS U.S. OPPOSES SOVIET BANK MEMBERSHIP

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.     Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the IMF."     Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified and unconditional."     Baker was responding to a questioner who noted that World Bank President Barber Conable has in the past suggested future Soviet membership could take place.  Reuter &#3;
