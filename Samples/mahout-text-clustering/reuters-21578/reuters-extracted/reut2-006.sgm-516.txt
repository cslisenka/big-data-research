Pacad Inc said it has entered into a contractual agreement with <Okamoto U.S.A. Inc> to market condoms manufactured by Okamoto's parent company, Okamoto Riken Gomu Co Ltd of Japan.     Pacad president David Tucker said the agreement covered the entire U.S. and Caribbean.     "With mounting public health concerns we expect our condom sales to begin within 30 days and grow rapidly in 1987," Tucker said. "We find perception of quality and value in Japanese products is just now crossing over from cars and cameras to condoms."  Reuter &#3;
