THATCHER PARTY HAS NINE POINT POLL LEAD

Britain's ruling Conservatives have a nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published in the Sunday Times.     The MORI poll's findings come as the latest in a series of setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.     The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against 32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.     The poll, which follows a survey by Marplan last week giving the Conservatives a six-point lead over Labour, shows how dramatically the fortunes of Britain's two largest parties have changed over the past six months.     As recently as September, Labour was still ahead in opinion polls and was looking forward to forming Britain's next government. Since then, it has been beset by inner wrangling and its popularity among Britain's voters has tumbled.     Morale among Labour politicians slumped further last month when the party lost a key by-election in Greenwich, south London -- a seat which Labour had held for 50 years.  REUTER &#3;
