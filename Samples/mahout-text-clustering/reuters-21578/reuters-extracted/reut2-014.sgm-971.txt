<NORTH STAR URANIUM INC> CHANGES NAME

North Star Uranium Inc said it has changed its name to West Coast Traders Inc to reflect its business, the bulk importing of olive oil.     The company said it plans to start distributing its Italia Olive Oil brand, now sold on the West Coast, nationally.     North Star Uranium had been inactive until it acquired West Coast Traders in June 1986.  Reuter &#3;
