BALLADUR DEFENDS CGCT DECISION ON ERICSSON

French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the government awarded control of <Compagnie Generale de Constructions Telephonques> (CGCT) to a consortium headed by Sweden's AB LM Ericsson <ERIC.ST> last week because its proposal was "judged technically sound and valid."     Balladur, responding to a question following a speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce, said the successful bid by Ericsson and French partners Matra <MATR.PA> and <Banque Indosuez> was "well organised and equipment will be readily available." He did not comment further.     CGCT has 16 pct of France's telephone switching market.  Reuter &#3;
