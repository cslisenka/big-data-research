CFTC LIMIT PLAN MAY NOT REVERSE LIQUIDITY DROP

A proposal by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futures speculative positions for certain agricultural commodity contracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in those markets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.     Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a House Agriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have the effect of raising deferred month speculative position limits on several agricultural commodity contracts would not substantially increase liquidity in those months.     "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits will create a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Seale told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.     Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a 1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment of so-called straddles limited the ability of futures commission merchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.     CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commission would take into account Congress' recommendation that federal speculative limits be raised.     The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan would decrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts.  Reuter &#3;
