ADMINISTRATION SAYS INSURANCE CRISIS EASED

The Reagan administration said the national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to 11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.     An administration working group, in an update of its report a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.     After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general, the group said in a 98-page study.     While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some sectors of the American economy.     Some types of insurance, especially associated with environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies at any price, it said.     The increased availability and the price stability for insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy restrictions, the study said.     The administration last year unveiled a wide range of recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including  limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and mental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.     Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference today that the administration still supports state efforts to place limits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tort laws.     Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied charges by consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused by industry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrust laws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive jury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance liability problem.  Reuter &#3;
