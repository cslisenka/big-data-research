GERMAN STOCKS SYSTEM SHOULD DEVELOP ALONGSIDE CITY

The German auction system of shares trading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallel to off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "Big Bang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.     Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if the Frankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurt exchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and was investing 86 mln marks in renovating its building. A screen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be in place too.     The nature of the auction system limited how far trading hours could be extended from the present two-hour session.     Other practical problems inhibited the German ability to follow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices, were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meant transfer of securities control to an independent body, if desired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.     "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rules for pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lent out for the kind of speculative positions taken by London market makers.     But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised for being too distant from those it should serve.  REUTER &#3;
