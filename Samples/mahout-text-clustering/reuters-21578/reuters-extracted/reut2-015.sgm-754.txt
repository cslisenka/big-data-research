CANADIAN AIRLINES, FLYING TIGER IN PACT

(Canadian Airlines International Ltd) said it signed an agreement with (The Flying Tiger Line Inc), that will offer Canada's first around-the-world cargo service.     The service, from Mirabel airport, will link Canada to a large network of worldwide air freight markets using wide-body B747 freighter aircraft, Canadian Airlines said.     It said the agreement calls for the two companies to share aircraft capacity on a 50/50 basis and compete independently for cargo on the route.     The airline said the joint operating agreement will give Canadian shippers a fast, reliable and cost effective way of moving their products to major markets, including the U.S.  Reuter &#3;
