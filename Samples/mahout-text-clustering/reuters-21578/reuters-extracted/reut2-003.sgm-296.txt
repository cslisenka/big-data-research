ELI LILLY AND CO <LLY> GETS DRUG APPROVAL

Eli Lilly and Co said it obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration to market the natural sequence human growth hormone, humatrope, made by recombinant DNA technolgoy.     The company said humatrope is identical in chemistry and structure to the growth hormone produced by the human body. It is the only commercially available biosysnthetic human growth hormone that is identical to naturally-occurring growth hormone, according to the company.     It said humatrope is indicated only for the long term treatment of children who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of the body's own normal growth hormone.     Humatrope joins humulin, human insulin in Eli Lilly and Co's line of human health care products of recombinant DNA origin.   Reuter &#3;
