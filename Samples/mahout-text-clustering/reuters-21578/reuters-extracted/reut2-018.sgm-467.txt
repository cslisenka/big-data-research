AUSTRALIAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOCUSSES ON TAX CUTS

Treasurer Paul Keating said the opposition's tax-cutting policy, a key issue in the run up to the July 11 elections, was a miscalculation that would severely damage the Australian economy.     Opposition leader John Howard disputed Keating's allegations. "Keating is engaged in a desperate, last ditch panic attempt to deny long-suffering Australian taxpayers the cuts to which they are entitled," he said.     Keating said in a radio interview that errors in Howard's plan, including "double counting," would increase the budget deficit and could push interest rates above 20 pct.     Keating said that Treasury officials who had studied Howard's plans concluded that his proposed tax and spending cuts would result in a nine billion dlr deficit and damage international market confidence in Australia.     In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budget deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and three billion dlrs.     Howard has said a conservative government under his leadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company tax level to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting government spending.     Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not to increase taxes or impose new ones, but rejected any tax cuts. Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints to help overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems.     Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 from an annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter.     Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by the middle of next year.     Australian bank lending rates to best customers have dropped to around 16.5 pct from a high of 19 pct nine months ago.  REUTER &#3;
