LONDON SUGAR DOWN 1.40 TO 2.00 DLRS BY MIDDAY

Raw sugar futures were near session lows by midday, sustaining losses of 1.40 to 2.00 dlrs a tonne from last night's slightly easier close, dealers said.     Volume was 484 lots.     Lack of follow-through after yesterday's midsession steadiness played a part in the decline which saw light liquidation and technical selling, dealers said.     There was no fresh physicals news although there are whites buying tenders tomorrow by India and Syria which will coincide with the weekly export tender by the European Community (EC).     Pakistan tenders on Saturday for 100,000 tonnes whites.     Near Aug terminal was finally quoted at 154.40/154.60 dlrs (bid-asked) from 155.80/156 last night and a session high-low of 155.80/154 dlrs.     London Daily Raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 fob and 171 (105.50 stg) cif.     The Whites price was down 2.50 dlrs to 190.  REUTER &#3;
