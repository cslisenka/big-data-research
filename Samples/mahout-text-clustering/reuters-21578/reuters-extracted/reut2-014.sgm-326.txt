ITALIAN BANK DEPOSIT GUARANTEE FUND APPROVED

The executive committee of the Italian national banking association (ABI), representing the country's major credit institutions, approved the setting up of a common reserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event of bank failures.     ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conference that the fund would not be operative until the latter part of 1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representing at least 75 pct of total deposits participated.     He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lire available and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.     A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund has already been approved by the Bank of Italy and by an interministerial committee on credit and savings.     The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will be provided through contributions from banks which opt to join the scheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000 billion lire.     Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to 4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision to achieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was due to fiscal considerations.     The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABI's steering committee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to 200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and one billion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and three billion lire.     Assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions would be equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a bank's total deposits.     The ABI's steering committee later unanimously ratified the executive committee's decision to create the common reserve fund.  REUTER &#3;
