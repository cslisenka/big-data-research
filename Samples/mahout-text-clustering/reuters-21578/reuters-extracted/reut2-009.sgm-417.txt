TORONTO DOMINION BUYING MONTREAL EXCHANGE SEAT

<Toronto Dominion Bank> said it agreed to purchase a seat on the Montreal Stock Exchange for 40,000 dlrs, subject to regulatory and exchange approval.     The move came two weeks after Toronto Dominion paid 195,000 dlrs for a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which made it the first bank to apply for membership on a Canadian exchange. The Toronto and Montreal exchanges are Canada's two biggest equity markets.     Proposed Canadian government legislation would allow banks full participation in the securities business after June 30. Toronto Dominion has owned a discount brokerage since 1984.  Reuter &#3;
