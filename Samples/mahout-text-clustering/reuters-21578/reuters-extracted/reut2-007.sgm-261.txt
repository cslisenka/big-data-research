INTELLICARD <ICRDC> GETS NASDAQ EXCEPTION

IntelliCARD International Inc said its common stock will continue to be quoted on NASDAQ due to an exception from capital asset requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which it failed to meet as of December 16.     The company said it believes it can meet conditions imposed by the NASD for the exception, but there is no assurance that it will be able to do so.  Reuter &#3;
