ENDOTRONICS <ENDO> REDUCES STAFF

Endotronics Inc said it has cut about 70 employees, or 42 pct of its worforce.     It said the action is necessary to successfully reorganize the company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, for which it filed last week.     A company spokesman also said Eugene Gruenberg, Michael Gruenberg and Jeffrey Ringhofer have severed all ties from the company.     Last week these men resigned from executive posts - Eugene Gruenberg had been chairman and chief executive, Michael Gruenberg had been president and chief operating officer, and Ringhofer had been vice president of marketing. But they had retained other duties until Monday, the spokesman said.  Reuter &#3;
