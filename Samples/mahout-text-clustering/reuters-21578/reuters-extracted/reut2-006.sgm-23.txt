 EC COMMISSION TO VISIT BONN AT KOHL'S INVITATION

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has invited the European Community's 17-man Commission for talks in Bonn next month in a bid to repair strained relations, EC diplomats said.     The Commissioners, led by President Jacques Delors, will pay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due for a meeting with the principal West German cabinet members.     The meeting, the first of its kind between the Commission and the government of a member state, was originally meant to focus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution.     But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated by Commission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances and its costly farm policy, which have provoked strong opposition from Bonn.     Kohl has written two letters to Delors, complaining that the plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farm minister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two German members of the Commission for failing to oppose them.     This caused protest from Brussels where the Commission tries to guard the independence of its members from the governments that nominate them.  REUTER &#3;
