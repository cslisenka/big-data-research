INDIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO RAISE 10 BILLION YEN

The state-owned Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has given <Morgan Guaranty Ltd, Hong Kong> the mandate to arrange a 10 billion yen loan in Japan, a senior IDBI official told Reuters.     The 15-year loan, to be signed next month, carries interest pegged to the Japanese long-term prime rate, now at around five pct per annum, said the official who declined to be named.     The loan will be IDBI's first foreign currency borrowing for the financial year beginning July 1, 1987, he said without specifying IDBI's total targetted borrowings for the year.     IDBI, which has raised 85 mln dlrs in Euroloans and 100 mln Swiss Francs in 1986/87, first entered the Japanese market in 1984/85 by raising two loans of five billion yen each, followed by a 10 billion Euroyen loan last year.     IDBI lends foreign currency funds to local industrial borrowers to help them import capital goods.     Bankers said the Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India, India's only private sector financial institution, is holding talks with foreign banks on arranging a loan of 10 billion yen. They said India's commercial borrowings in 1987/88 may remain at the 1986/87 level of 1.5 billion dlrs.  REUTER &#3;
