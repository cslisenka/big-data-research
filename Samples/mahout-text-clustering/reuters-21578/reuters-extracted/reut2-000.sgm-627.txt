U.S. DELEGATION PLANS TO LEAVE ICO TALKS TUESDAY

The U.S. Delegation at the International Coffee Organization (ICO) talks on export quotas is planning to leave tomorrow morning, but will ask a representative from the U.S. Embassy in London to attend the negotiations if they continue, a U.S. Spokesman said.     One delegate said: "If the U.S. Delegation is going home and the Brazilians are not budging, then there's no negotiation."     A full ICO council meeting is set for 1900 hours local for a progress report. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching an agreement vary widely and several delegates have said the chances of success were almost impossible to gauge.  Reuter &#3;
