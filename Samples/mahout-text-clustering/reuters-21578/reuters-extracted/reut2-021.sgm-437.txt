ATT <T> PLANS COMPUTER USING SUN <SUNW.O> CHIP

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it plans to build a new computer that incorrates a unified version of its UNIX System IV operating system and Sun Microsystems Inc's recently annouced SPARC micropocessor.     The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, technology.      ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer will incorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, a dirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific and engineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant of the Berkely system sold by Sun.     ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to develop new computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged version of the UNIX operating system.     Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed Data Systems Group, said the company will not offer the new machines until the merged version of UNIX is completed.     "It's the software that will determine the availability of products based on SPARC," he said.     Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will be converted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.         The investment of all current users will be protected, meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used on the current 3B line, he said.     Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in the first nine months of the year compared with the first nine months of last year.     The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT's transition to a new line of computers, he said.     However, "demand for the new products is way, way above expectation," he stated.  Reuter &#3;
