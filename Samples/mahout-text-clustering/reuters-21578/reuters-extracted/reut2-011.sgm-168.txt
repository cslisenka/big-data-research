JAPAN TO DEVELOP FIGHTER PLANE WITH U.S.

Japan has decided to cooperate with the U.S. To develop a new generation of fighter planes, Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara said.     Japan is now in a major trade dispute with Washington, but Kurihara told reporters the decision was not made in response to outside pressure and described the project as a Japanese-led program with U.S. Cooperation.     President Ronald Reagan said last week that the U.S. Would impose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate against alleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact.     The plane, codenamed the FSX, has been the focus of competition between Japanese and U.S. Defence contractors. At stake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts which the Japanese government had previously intended to award to domestic firms.     The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's self defence forces, will be equipped with high technology radar dodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very low altitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.     The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all 77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.     A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of the announcement had nothing to do with escalating trade friction between Japan and the U.S., Its largest trading partner.     "This is an objective decision, made after discussions with U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger," he said.     However, with two weeks to go before the U.S. Imposes tariffs, Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, told Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must address individual market-opening issues, such as the FSX, defence ministry officials said.
