POLL SHOWS AMERICANS HOLD ON TO STOCKS AFTER DROP

The "Black Monday" stock market crash failed to destroy Americans' faith in the economic soundness of the country, according to a poll released on Tuesday.     The ABC-Washington Post poll, taken after the close of stock trading on Monday, showed 58 pct did not believe the unprecedented slide in stock prices foretold an economic downturn, and 70 pct rejected the notion the country faced a 1930s-style Depression.     Fifty-three pct of those interviewed said they had owned stocks at some point, and only one pct said they had sold any as a result of Monday's decline.     Of the 40 pct who currently held stocks, only two pct said they planned to sell some and four pct said they planned to buy.     The poll of 507 men and women was taken by telephone on Monday night, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points, or 22 pct, in record volume.  REUTER &#3;
