MYLES <MYLX> RESUMES SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMER

Mylex Corp said it has received scheduled orders to resume shipments under an existing contract with one of its major customers that it did not name.     In May it said it did not have product releases from that customer.     Mylex also said it has introduced an International Business Machines Corp <IBM> personal computer compatible system board using Intel Corp's <INTC> 80386 microprocessor called the Mylex 386-A motherboard.  It said standard configuration includes one or four megabytes of onboard 32-bit random access memory and 64 kilobytes of cache memory.     Mylex said it will market the product directly and through distributors to original equipment manufacturers, value-added resellers and system integrators, with shipments to start in mid-April.
