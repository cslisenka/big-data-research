CONED <ED> AGREES TO CUT RATES, WRITE OFF DEBITS

Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc has agreed to reduce its rates 3.1 pct next month and write-off 50 mln dlrs of deferred debits, New York Governor Mario M. Cuomo said.     He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases until at least April 1990.     Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General, the City of New York and several other parties.     He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years.     As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since March 1983," he added.     Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal taxes and lower interest rates.     The utility said another factor includes improved economic conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased sales.     It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984."  Reuter &#3;
