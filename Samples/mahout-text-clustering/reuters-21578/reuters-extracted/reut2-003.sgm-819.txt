SECURITIES TRADE GROUP REPLIES TO SENATE VOTE

The Securities Industry Association said it strongly supports the decision yesterday by the Senate Banking Committee to freeze the entry by commerical banks into non-banking businesses such as the underwriting of commerical paper.     "This committee vote is not only a prudent and thoughtful approach to review of the Glass-Steagall Act, but a strong and needed message from the Senate that it is the responsibility of Congress to review, and if necessary, amend the nation's banking laws," the association said in a statement.
