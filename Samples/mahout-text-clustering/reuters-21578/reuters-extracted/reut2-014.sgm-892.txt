ELDERS PLANS TO FLOAT OFF COURAGE PUBS

Elders IXL Ltd <ELXA.S> plans to float off the around 5,000 public houses belonging to its U.K. Subsidiary Courage Ltd to raise about one billion stg, Elders strategy executive director Stuart Kelso said.     The scheme, subject of speculation in a Scottish newspaper yesterday, was fairly well advanced, but not certain to go ahead. "There could be road blocks," he added.     The earliest flotation date would be June, though the sale will probably be later. Elders would retain a one-third interest in the property interests under the current plan.     No immediate use has been earmarked for the funds raised.     Kelso said float plans currently include an offering of debentures to institutional investors and issues of ordinary shares and convertible stock for sale to the public.     Elders bought Courage from Hanson Trust Plc <HNSN.L> last year for 1.4 mln stg. The deal followed Elders' unsuccessful efforts to expand into the U.K. Drinks industry by acquiring Allied-Lyons Plc <ALLD.L>.     Hanson acquired Courage when it took over Imperial Group Plc early last year. The Elders plan to raise funds from Courage is a variant of the its earlier scheme to sell off 50 pct stakes in the Allied-Lyons pubs to their publicans, market sources added.  REUTER &#3;
