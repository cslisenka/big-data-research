RUBBER PRICES FIRM AT COLOMBO AUCTION

Rubber prices of all types firmed on good demand for the 234 mln kilos offered at the Colombo auction, brokers said.     Among latex crepe, the best crepe one-X sold at an average 20.10 rupees per kilo, up five cents from previous levels. Crepe two traded at 19.60 against 19.50 last week and other grades also showed gains.     Trade sources reported increased demand and more speculative buying compared to earlier weeks.     Among sheet offerings, RSS1 gained 20 cents from last week to trade at 19.00 rupees a kilo. Other sheet rubbers were also firm on speculative buying.     Brokers noted bidding remained steady throughout the sale, particularly for the best crepes and RSS1 types.  REUTER &#3;
