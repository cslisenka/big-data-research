S. AFRICA MINERS DEFY SINGLE-SEX RULE IN HOSTELS

Black miners, rebelling against the loneliness of men-only hostels, have brought wives and children to live with them at seven South African coal mines, a union leader said today.     Cyril Ramaphosa told a news conference about 600 wives and children moved into the hostels last weekend, in defiance of single-sex regulations. About 350 left after the weekend but the others stayed on.     "The time has come for them (miners and families) to start living naturally," said Ramaphosa, who is president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).     A spokesman for Anglo-American, the giant corporation which owns the mines affected, said negotiations were being held with the NUM on the issue.  Reuter &#3;
