TRW <TRW> WINS JAPANESE AIRPORT CONTRACT

TRW Inc said it was selected to perform fact-finding security system surveys for the authority that is building Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan.     The company said the 340,000 dlr contract was significant because it was the first contract issued by the authority solely to an American company without Japanese partners.     The contract calls for TRW to perform studies of other international airport security systems on behalf of Kansai, the company said.     Kansai is scheduled to be operational in 1993.  Reuter &#3;
