KLM LOWERS TRANSATLANTIC FARES

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines <KLM.AS>, in a move following similar steps recently by U.S. carrier TWA, said it is cutting its fares on transatlantic flights from April 1.     From April 1, a return fare Amsterdam-New York will be cut by eight per cent to 1,099 guilders for the low season until mid-June, when seasonal increases will come into effect.     KLM recently rejected invitations by TWA to coordinate price cuts on the Amsterdam route and a spokesman said KLM had only moved now to start up a nationwide promotional campaign in the Netherlands to boost travel to the U.S.  Reuter &#3;
