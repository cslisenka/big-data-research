GM LAYING OFF 5,500 AT TWO MICHIGAN PLANTS

General Motors Corp said it ordered temporary layoffs of 5,500 hourly workers to cut production and thereby reduce inventories of cars built at two plants later this month.     A spokesman said 2,000 workers would be laid off one week beginning March 9 at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck luxury car plant.     Another 3,500 will be laid off a week effective March 23 at GM's Lansing, Mich, plant which builds the company's "N-body" compact cars.  Reuter &#3;
