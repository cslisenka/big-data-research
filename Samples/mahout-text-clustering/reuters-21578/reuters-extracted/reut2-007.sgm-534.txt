U.S. SAY SOVIET UNION HAS EXCEEDED MISSILE PACT

President Reagan accused the Soviet Union of exceeding a traditional restrictive reading of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, but said the U.S. Saw no reason yet to follow suit.     "We believe that the Soviet Union has been going even beyond a liberal interpretation of the treaty," he said at a news conference.     There has been speculation the U.S. Administration was moving toward a looser reading of the treaty in order to permit the development of the "Star Wars" anti-missile system, but Reagan said no decision has yet been made.
