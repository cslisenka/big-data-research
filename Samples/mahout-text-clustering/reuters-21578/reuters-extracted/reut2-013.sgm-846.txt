U.S. ENERGY FUTURES POST GAINS AFTER FIRM OPEN

Light mixed buying around the rings boosted U.S. energy futures to new daily highs after a slightly firmer open, traders said.     May crude jumped 15 cts to 18.82 dlrs a barrel, nearing the top end of a 17.75-18.85 dlrs resistance range. Traders said firmness in the North Sea Brent cash crude market plus reports of escalation in the Iran/Iraq war lent support to crude futures. April 15-day forward Brent crude traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today.     Traders said resistance continues overhead near 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude futures.      Gasoline continued to post larger gains than heating oil and to trade at a premium to two oil futures. May gasoline was up 0.56 cent to 53.50 cts a gallon, at resistance.     May heating oil was up 0.36 cent to 49.15 cts a gallon.  Both contracts were off 0.05 cent from this morning's high.  Reuter &#3;
