GREECE ACCUSES TURKEY OF AIR SPACE INFRINGEMENTS

Greece accused Turkish warplanes of infringing the Athens Flight Information Region (FIR) in the Aegean Sea three times.     The Defense Ministry said the Turkish intrusions took place over the islands of Chios, Samos, Lesbos and Lemnos. The planes were identified and intercepted by Greek fighters, it said.     Greece has charged Turkish aircraft with 10 other FIR infringements and two air space violations in the Aegean over the last two days.  Reuter &#3;
