U.S., CANADA SWITCH TO DAYLIGHT TIME SUNDAY

The United States switches to daylight saving time on Sunday, April 5, when clocks will be turned ahead one hour at 0200 in all time zones.     The states of Arizona and Hawaii and parts of Indiana, including Indianapolis, remain on standard time by local choice.     Congress voted last year to move the start of daylight time from the last Sunday in April to the first Sunday in April. The return to standard time remains the last Sunday in October (October 25 this year).     Canada also switches to daylight time on Sunday.  Reuter &#3;
