FIAT EXPECTS SHARP 1987 SALES GROWTH

Fiat SpA <FIAT.MI> expects its consolidated group sales to reach 37,000 to 38,000 billion lire in 1987 against a provisional 29,020 billion lire announced for 1986, managing director Cesare Romiti said.     Romiti, speaking at a meeting of industrial managers and engineering students, said the expected sales growth partly reflected recent acqusitions such as that of <Alfa-Romeo SpA>.     Alfa Romeo was acquired late last year and merged with Fiat's Lancia unit to form a new company, Alfa-Lancia Industriale Spa <ALFI.MI>.  Reuter &#3;
