CBT WHEAT FUTURES RALLY TO CLOSE HIGHER

CBT wheat futures rebounded from midsession lows to close 2-1/2 cents to 1/4 cent per bushel higher in light trade. May settled at 2.88-3/4 dlrs after posting a 2-3/4 cent range on the day.     After opening higher on followthrough speculative buying after yesterday's technically strong close, setting contract highs in new crop, prices eased on trade talk some countries who were holding buying tenders this week have rejected U.S. offers or have taken wheat from other exporting countries, traders said.     However, the strong chart picture and strength in corn and soybeans provided solid background support for wheat.     Cargill was the featured seller in new crop July, sparking the midsession selloff.  Reuter &#3;
