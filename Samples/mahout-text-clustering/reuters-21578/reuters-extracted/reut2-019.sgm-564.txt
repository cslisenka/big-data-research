HENKEL EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 TURNOVER, PROFIT

Henkel KGaA <HNKG.F> expects 1987 world group turnover and profit to exceed 1986 levels as recent acquisitions should compensate for the negative impact of the strong mark, managing board chairman Helmut Sihler said.     He told the annual meeting that based on Henkel's performance so far, the profit increase would be "not insignificant."     World group sales rose six pct in the first five months this year compared with the same 1986 period but group turnover rose only two pct because of currency factors, he said.     Sihler said the profit increase surpassed that of turnover but gave no figure.     As reported, group net profit rose 28 pct to 226 mln marks in 1986. World group sales by volume rose six pct but currency factors trimmed group turnover by six pct to 8.7 billion marks.     Sihler said the 1986 profit/sales ratio of 2.6 pct should rise further this year.     Sihler said turnover grew more or less equally in all sectors.     As reported, the 1986 dividend on ordinary voting shares rose to 4.50 marks from 3.50 in 1985 while the dividend on non-voting preference shares increased to 7.50 marks compared with three marks for six months of 1985.
