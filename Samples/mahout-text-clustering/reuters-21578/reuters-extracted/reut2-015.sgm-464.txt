GALAXY OIL <GOX> BEING DELISTED BY AMEX

Galaxy Oil Co said its common stock and nine pct convertible subordinated debentures due 1994 are being delisted from the <American Stock Exchange> because the company no longer meets listing criteria.     Galaxy filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April Six.     The company said trading in both issues will be suspended by the Amex at the close on May One but is expected to start elsewhere on May Four.
