VOLVO TO BE LISTED ON SWISS BOURSES

Sweden's Volvo AB <VOLV ST> said its B-Free shares are to be listed on the Zurich, Basle and Geneva bourses in the autumn.     The company said in a statement that the new listing would further expand the number of international bourses on which Volvo shares are quoted. It is already quoted on stock exchanges in Sweden, Britain, West Germany, France, Belgium, Norway and Tokyo, and its shares are also traded over-the-counter in the United States.     "Switzerland attracts us as one of the most international capital markets," Lennart Jeansson, of the Volvo board, said.     A Swiss bank consortium led by Credit Suisse had carried out a secondary placement of 500,000 B-Free Volvo shares on the Swiss market in preparation for Volvo's autumn entry onto the bourses, Volvo said.
