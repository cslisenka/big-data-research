GANDALF <GANDF> INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS

Gandalf Technologies Inc said it introduced two new products, one of which allows its private automatic computer exchange networking systems to connect directly to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC>'s Unibus-equipped computers.     The company said its new VGS 2518 communications gateway server provides a high capacity pathway for high speed asynchronous data transfer between Unibus systems and Gandalf's PACX 200 and PACX 2000 systems. Gandalf said it is the first in a series of high bandwidth gateway servers it plans to introduce this year.     Gandalf said its other new product is the MUX 2000 multiplexing system, which offers a mix of voice and data capabilities and allows users to select from among four Gandalf multiplexing elements.     The company said this flexibility will be attractive to large users. "The larger the network, the more likely that flexible multiplexing solutions are required," a Gandalf statement said.
