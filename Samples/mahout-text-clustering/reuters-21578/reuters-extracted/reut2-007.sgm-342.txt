U.S. CONGRESS THIRD WORLD DEBT PLAN ADVANCES

A House Banking subcommittee approved a plan to seek U.S. negotiations with other industrialized countries for the purchase of developing country debt from commercial banks.     The plan is expected to face opposition in the full House Banking Committee, where approval must be obtained to send it on to the full House for a vote, congressional sources said.     Under their plan, Treasury Secretary James Baker would be directed to consider setting up a public debt authority to purchase developing country debt at a discount. The debt would be repackaged for sale to a secondary market.     The debt plan was offered by International Development Institutions subcommitte chairman Walter Fauntroy, a non-voting Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.     The negotiations would aim for renegotiation of third world debt with the new U.S. Public Debt Management Authority. The new U.S. institution would act as manager for the loans and oversee economic policies of the developing countries.     One of its main purposes is the reduction in the debt service burden of developing countries, Fauntroy said.     In addition, the bill asks for a study of the issuance of of Special Drawing Rights to developing countries.  Reuter &#3;
