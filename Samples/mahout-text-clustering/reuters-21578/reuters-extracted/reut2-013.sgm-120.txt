WRIGLEY <WWY> RAISES GUM PRICE, SELLS NEW SIZE

Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co said it raised the wholesale price for seven-stick packages of its Spearmint, Juicy Fruit, Doublemint and Big Red brands, marching competitive moves to a 35 cts retail price. The gum previously sold at 30 cts a pack.     The company also said on March 30 it brought out a five-stick package of the four brands. The new package-size, generally phased out by the trade in 1972, was priced at 25 cts a pack, Wrigley said. A company spokesman said the five-stick size was "well received" by the trade.
