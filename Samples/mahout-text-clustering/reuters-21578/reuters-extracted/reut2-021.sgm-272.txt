MONSANTO <MTC> NUTRASWEET SALES SHOW SMALL DROP

Monsanto Co said sales of its Nutrasweet artificial sweetener fell slightly in the third quarter due to a continuing decline in usage by the powdered soft drink market.     "It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvement in the powdered soft drink sector," said Donna Smith, a Monsanto spokeswoman.     The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billion dlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to 177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.     A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which use Nutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chief economist Nick Filippello.     Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippello said, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated soft drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end, up from 25 pct in 1986.     That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet in such items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pct increase in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987, Filippello said.     Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on the company's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.     However, Filippello said it was fair to assume that Monsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet soda market.     Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarter of 1986 when medical studies raised questions about its possible side effects, such as migraine headaches.     Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle and Co, Nutrasweet's maker in 1986.  Reuter &#3;
