TRANSCANADA <TRP> UPS DOME <DMP> BID - REPORT

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd has raised its takeover offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd to 5.5 billion Canadian dlrs from 4.3 billion, according to a report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC).     However, a spokesman for Dome said the company is not interested, since it has already agreed to be acquired by Amoco Corp <AN> for 5.1 billion dlrs, the CBC said.     Spokesmen at Dome and TransCanada could not immediately be reached for comment.     Although Dome has said it is only interested in the Amoco offer, a spokesman for TransCanada was quoted as saying that the ultimate decision rests with Dome shareholders.     "I don't know what (Dome chairman J. Howard Madconald) is going to say if a letter lands on his desk and he's got an offer there equal or better for the shareholders than the one he has on his desk at this time," TransCanada chief financial officer Neil Nichols was quoted as saying.
