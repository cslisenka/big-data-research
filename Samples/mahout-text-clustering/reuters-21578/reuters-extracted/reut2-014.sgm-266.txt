ERICSSON <ERICY> GETS U S WEST <USW> ORDER

L.M. Ericsson Telephone Co said it has received a contract to provide U S West Inc with AXE digital central office switching equipment for use in Idaho, replacing 50 older electro-mechanical switches.     Value was not disclosed.     The company said U S West's Mountain Bell will place the first AXE in service before year-end and the project is to be completed by the end of 1991.     The company said the replacement program follows an agreement between Mountain Bell and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for conversion of a substantial part of the Idaho telephone network to digital from analog technology over the next five years.
