JAPAN, BRITAIN TO EXCHANGE SECURITIES MARKET INFO

Japan and Britain have signed a memorandum on exchange of securities market information to protect investors and promote the integrity of securities markets, Finance Ministry officials said.     As interaction between Japanese and U.K. Securities markets grows, it is desirable for both countries to exchange supervisory and investigatory information to assist each other in securing compliance with their statutes, rules and requirements, the memorandum said.     The ministry's securities bureau has a similar arrangement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  REUTER &#3;
