GERMAN BOURSE TURNOVER TAX DECISION ANGERS BANKS

The failure of the West German government to abolish a tax on bourse turnover when other taxes came under discussion during recent coalition negotiations was a "bitter disappointment," the president of the West German Federation of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, said.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference that, contrary to numerous assurances from the government, the abolition of the turnover tax had not been touched upon.     "This must not be allowed to be the last word. Otherwise a major chance for West Germany as a financial centre will have been missed," he said.     After the January 25 election the government decided upon a reform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.     In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetary conference in Paris, the government said earlier this month part of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.     Government sources have said the fact the latest coalition discussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does not necessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolished later in the current four-year legislative period.     The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades where an end-investor is involved, generated government revenue of some 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons for maintaining the tax because companies would benefit from its abolition. Their earnings would increase and the government would receive more in profits tax.     Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said the bourse tax decision did not fit into the general background of liberalisation of the German capital market, and represented a weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.
