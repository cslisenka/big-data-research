CHIRAC ATTACKS EC COMMISSION BUDGET PROPOSALS

Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has attacked budget proposals made by the European Community's executive Commission, saying they ignore efforts to cut spending, and added that divisions over the issue would be hard to resolve at this week's EC summit.     The Commission has proposed radical changes in the way the member countries contribute to the budget, suggesting payments should be linked to economic output instead of tax revenue.     But the richer northern nations such as Britain, West Germany and France are insisting on stricter spending controls before agreeing to any reform.     "The proposals of the Commission, at the level they are being made, are not compatible with the efforts which each of our nations is making to reduce spending ... Therefore there is a big problem," Chirac said in a radio interview.     EC leaders would also try to resolve a dispute on reforms of agricultural spending, largely to blame for an expected 5.7 billion dlr shortfall in the EC budget this year.     Chirac said that West Germany, under pressure from its powerful farm lobby, was alone in opposing reforms to the common agricultural policy, while France shared a common position on the issue with the 10 other EC states.
