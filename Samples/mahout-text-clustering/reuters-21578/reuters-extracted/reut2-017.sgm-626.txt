TELEGLOBE HAS CANADA/FRANCE SATELLITE LINK

Teleglobe Canada Inc, owned by Memotec Data Inc (MDI.M), said it received an order from Credit Lyonnais Canada for a direct satellite link between Canada and France that will be the first private satellite network between the two countries.     Value of the contract was undisclosed.     Teleglobe said the connection will provide the bank with a permanent link to the digital phone switch at its parent company's Paris headquarters and connect it with Credit Lyonnais' network in France and the rest of the world.
