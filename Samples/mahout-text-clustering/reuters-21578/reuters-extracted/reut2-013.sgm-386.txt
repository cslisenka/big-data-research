ASIAN DOLLAR DEPOSITS CLOSE QUIETLY STEADY

Asian dollar deposit rates closed steady at opening levels in dull and featureless trading, dealers said.     They said most operators refrained from taking large positions amid expectations that the group of seven would hold currency talks on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund conference in Washington later this week.     Short-dates were mostly steady at the outset and remained unchanged in subsequent trading.     Overnight, Wednesday/Thursday and week-fixed closed at a common 6-5/16 6-3/16 pct.     Term rates were little changed from earlier levels of 6-1/2 6-3/8 pct for one month, 6-9/16 6-7/16 pct for three months, 6-11/16 6-9/16 pct for six months and 6-13/16 6-11/16 pct for one year.     Asian dollar CD rates held unchanged at the morning's levels in quiet trading, dealers said.     One month closed at 6.45/35 pct, three months at 6.55/45 pct and six months at 6.65/55 pct.
