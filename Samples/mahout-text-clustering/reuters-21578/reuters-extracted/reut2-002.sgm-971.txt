INDONESIA SAID TO BE STABLE AHEAD OF ELECTIONS

Indonesia's Armed Forces Commander General Benny Murdani said warnings about an extremist threat to the country's forthcoming elections do not mean the security situation has deteriorated.    He was quoted in today's edition of the armed forces newspaper Harian AB as saying the warnings were only an appeal for vigilance ahead of the April 23 polls.     Major-General Setijana, military commander of central Java, said in widely-quoted remarks last week that both leftist and rightist extremists were planning to sabotage the polls in an attempt to topple President Suharto's government.     Murdani told a meeting of the ruling Golkar party in Jakarta yesterday that he believed the security situation was now stable.     However, he also said mass meetings during the election campaign period should be avoided, as they could trigger what he termed a critical situation very easily.     About 60 people died in accidents and election-related violence during the last parliamentary elections in 1982.  REUTER   &#3;
