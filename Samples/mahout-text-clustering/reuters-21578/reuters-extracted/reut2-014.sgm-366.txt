BIFFEX FALLS FURTHER BY CLOSE

Dry cargo futures on BIFFEX extended early losses during the afternoon session to close 30 to 52 points lower because of uncertainty as to where the physical market will go in the near term, dealers said.     Initial panic profit-taking snowballed and triggered further sell stops. A 2.5 point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1030.5 further dampened sentiment after its strong advance over the past week, they added.     Rumours of lower rates circulated the market this afternoon, but some dealers said easier fixtures talked of today involved older tonnage and may not be representive of current conditions.
