MCA <MCA> NAMES SPIELBERG CREATIVE CONSULTANT

MCA Inc said noted film maker Steven Spielberg will serve as creative consultant for Universal Studios Tour Florida.     The tour is a joint venture between MCA and Cineplex Odeon Corp that is scheduled to open in 1989.     MCA is also planning a major expansion of its Universal Studio Tours. The expansion includes four live-action shows based films and TV series, including Spielberg's "E.T.".     MCA's actions are seen as spurred by The Disney Co's <DIS> Chairman Michal Eisner's intention to build a new attraction in the Los Angeles area, possibly a studio tour.  Reuter &#3;
