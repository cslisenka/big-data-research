SHULTZ BEGINS ARMS TALKS WITH SHEVARDNADZE

U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz was holding several hours of talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze today in pursuit of the first superpower arms control agreement in nearly a decade.     Shultz, accompanied by a panoply of senior advisers and technical experts, went directly into a closed-door meeting with Shevardnadze and the Soviet delegation after arriving in Moscow from Helsinki aboard a U.S. Air Force jet.     State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters traveling with the secretary that as the crucial talks got under way, U.S. Arms control advisers were instructed not to discuss the substance of the American proposals with the press.     It has been reported previously that some of the proposals -- such as those dealing with President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" space shield against enemy missiles -- represent a hardening of the U.S. Position.     Nevertheless, U.S. Officials have been optimistic about the possibility of progress on arms control during the talks, which are scheduled to end Wednesday.     Reagan, who is believed to want an agreement before he leaves office in 1989, said last week that a breakthrough on an accord eliminating intermediate-range missiles (INF) in Europe was a distinct possibility.
