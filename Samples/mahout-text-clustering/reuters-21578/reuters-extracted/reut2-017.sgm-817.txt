MOODY'S REVIEWS HOSPITAL CORP <HCA> DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it put Hospital Corp of America's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debt under review with uncertain direction.     Under review are the A-2 senior debt, A-3 convertible subordinated debt and Prime-2 commercial paper ratings.     Moody's cited the firm's planned sale of 104 U.S.-based hospitals to an employee stock ownership plan. The cost would be 1.8 billion dlrs in cash plus preferred stock and warrants.     Moody's expects favorable credit implications if the sale includes low-profit hospitals. Reducing Hospital's financial leverage will be needed to maintain credit quality, it said.  Reuter &#3;
