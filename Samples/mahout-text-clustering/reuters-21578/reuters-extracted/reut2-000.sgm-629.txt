MURGOLD RESOURCES <MGDVF> HAS PARTIAL ASSAYS

Murgold Resources Inc said the number three vein zone at its Timmins, Ontario property yielded partial assay results of 1.08 ounces gold a short ton across an average width of 4.2 feet and length of 200 feet.     It said many of the individual assays were more than one ounce a ton but had not been cut.     The company said these results were expected, because the structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very high-grade gold vein. Its known length is 2,800 feet and will be explored and tested as part of the underground work, Murgold said.  Reuter &#3;
