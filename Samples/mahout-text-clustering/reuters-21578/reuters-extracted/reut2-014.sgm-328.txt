LME NICKEL CLOSE SLIPS TO DAY'S LOW

LME nickel ended the afternoon rings with three months metal indicated from 2,355 to 2,360 stg per tonne, equivalent to 1.7175 dlrs per lb, unchanged from yesterday's afternoon kerb close.     The afternoon first ring slipped to the day's low of 2,355 in very quiet trading which mostly comprised miscellaneous carries, traders said. The session high of 2,370 stg was reached near the official morning ring close on trade buying before speculative profittaking and hedging operations halted the advance, traders said. Analysts said the brief rise above the 1.72 dlr level gave the market a slightly bullish appearance.     There was still borrowing interest over the last two delivery months at a narrower contango of five stg.  REUTER &#3;
