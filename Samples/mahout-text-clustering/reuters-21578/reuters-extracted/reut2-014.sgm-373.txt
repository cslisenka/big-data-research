N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES HIGHER AT MIDSESSION

Platinum futures were higher at midsession as the precious metal continued to mirror the action in the nearby silver pit, analysts said.     Silver was trading in the upper end of the day's wide range, bolstered by speculative buying on a belief that it would continue to rise toward seven dlrs an ounce basis May.     The key July platinum delivery traded at 571.50 dlrs an ounce, up 2.90 dlrs but under a session high of 577.50 dlrs. Other months were 3.70 to 7.30 dlrs higher.     However, trading was thin as many participants watched the foreign exchange and U.S. stock and bond markets.     Meanwhile, palladium was up 70 cts to 2.20 dlrs in sympathetic buying to platinum.
