BROWNING-FERRIS <BFI> UNIT SEEKS WASTE PERMIT

Browning-Ferris Industries Inc said its subsidiary, CECOS International Inc, said it intends to seek a permit to install an incinerator for burning hazardous wastes at a site in southwest Jefferson County in Kentucky.     In a related matter, CECOS said it will acquire <BT Energy> and its assets contingent on CECOS receiving the permit, it said.     BT Energy already has a permit to treat and store industrial and chemical wastes and has been providing services to the Jefferson County area for 13 years, CECOS said.     The application will be submitted in July and will require about one year for reviews and hearings before construction of the plant could start, CECOS said.     The cost of the project is estimated to be approximately 30 mln dlrs, CECOS said.  Reuter &#3;
