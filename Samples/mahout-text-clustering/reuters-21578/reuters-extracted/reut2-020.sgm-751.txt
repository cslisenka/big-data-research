STRIKE HITS BRAZIL'S LARGEST AUTO MANUFACTURER

An indefinite strike by 47,000 carworkers on Tuesday closed most Brazilian plants of Autolatina, the company said.     Autolatina, one of the world's largest automakers, said it had offered its employees a pay rise of 20.66 pct, adding that the workers were pressing for a 65.9 pct rise.     The strike is the first to hit operations of Autolatina since it formally came into existence on July 1. The company groups Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.     A spokesman said factories in Argentina were unaffected. He said about 9,000 of the company's 55,900 employees in Brazil were still working and some production was continuing.  Reuter &#3;
