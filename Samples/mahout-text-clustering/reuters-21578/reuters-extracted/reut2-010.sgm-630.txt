TENTATIVE PACT AGREED IN GM <GM.N> STRIKE

A tentative settlement has been reached in a three-day strike by 9,000 workers at a General Motors <GM.N> truck and bus complex, a union spokesman said.     United Auto Workers (UAW) spokesman Don Hooper told Reuters in a telephone interview a settlement had been reached and a ratification vote was expected today. He had no further details.     GM officials were unavailable for comment, but the head of security at one of the struck plants confirmed a tentative settlement of the dispute.     The UAW struck at three GM factories on Thursday as labor contract talks broke down on the issue of using non-union labour on subcontracting jobs.     About 9,000 hourly workers walked off the job after the UAW and management failed to come to an agreement by Thursday noon, a deadline set last week by the union.  REUTER &#3;
