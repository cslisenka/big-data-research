JAPAN PLANS MORE DECONTROL ON LARGE BANK DEPOSITS

The Finance Ministry plans to further ease restrictions on large-denomination bank deposits this year and is studying several deregulation plans, a ministry official said, without elaborating.     Banking sources told Reuters the ministry plans to lower the minimum denomination of money market certificates (MMCs) to 10 mln yen from 20 mln, the amount slated to be applied from April 6. The amount is currently 30 mln yen.     The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum period of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one month from the current three months, the sources said.     The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of certificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years from the current one month to one year, the sources said.     They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce a shift of funds from bank to other financial instruments.     One official of a major bank said the planned moves were unexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously expected to have ended with the measures to start in April.     On April 6, the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum time deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and cut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one.  REUTER &#3;
