CABLE AND WIRELESS IN MALAYSIA CABLE DEAL

Malaysia's telecommunication authority has entered into a deal with a British firm to instal a 100 mln dlrs fibre optic submarine cable to link Peninsula Malaysia with eastern Sabah and Sarawak states, the national news agency Bernama reported.     <Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd> (STM) signed an agreement to set up a joint venture company with Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC <CAWL.L> to instal, maintain and operate the 1,500 kms-long cable by 1989, it said.     STM Chairman Mohamed Rashdan Baba and Cable and Wireless Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Sharp signed the agreement.     The joint venture company will be 51 pct owned by STM and 49 pct by Cable and Wireless, the news agency said. It gave no details on equity or when the project will be started.     Mohamed Rashdan said the cable link will carry domestic and international telecommunication traffic and added that STM planned to ask other telecommunication administrations in Southeast Asia to use the cable.     Sharp said the cable could make Malaysia a major telecommunications centre in the region.     STM, which used to be the government's telecommunication department previously, was privatised in January 1987.  REUTER &#3;
