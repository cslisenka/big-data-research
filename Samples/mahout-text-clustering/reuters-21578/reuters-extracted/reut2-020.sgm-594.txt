SCOTT CABLE <JSCC> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it downgraded about 50 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures to B-3 from B-2 of Scott Cable Communications Inc.     Moody's cited the significant increase in leverage and the reduction in coverages that will result from the merger of Scott with Simmons Communications Merger Corp.     Scott lacks sufficient operating cash flow to fund the entire interest expense for the near term and will depend on bank financing to make up any shortfall, the agency noted.     It added that the B-3 rating recognizes operating efficiencies that will result from the merger.  Reuter &#3;
