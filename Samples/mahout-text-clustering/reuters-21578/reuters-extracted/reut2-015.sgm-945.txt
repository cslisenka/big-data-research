AMOCO <AN> OPTIMISTIC WITH STABLE OIL PRICES

Amoco Corp said it sees a more favorble outlook because of actions taken last year and a recent strengthening of oil prices.     "It appears now that the worst is behind us," said Amoco executive vice president Richard Leet in remarks prepared for delivery to security analysts in San Francisco. "We face the future with more optimism than we did a year ago," he said.     In response to last year's steep drop in oil prices, Amoco reduced and redirected exploration and production spending plans, expanded its cost cutting efforts and accelerated staff reductions, he noted.
