ITALIAN GOVERNMENT EXPECTED TO FALL TOMORROW

Italy's government is expected to fall tomorrow after the majority Christian Democrats decided to withdraw their 16 ministers unless Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi resigned, political sources said today.     They said the decision brought the prospect of early general elections even closer.     After a tense eight-hour meeting, the Christian Democrat leadership late last night said it registered "the dissolution of the present government," in which the party provides more than half the 30 ministers.     Party leader Ciriaco De Mita told reporters that when Craxi went to parliament for a confidence debate. "There won't be a Craxi government any more ... I don't believe you can have a confidence vote for a government which does not exist."     Craxi announced today after being told of the Christian Democrat decision that a cabinet meeting would be held tomorrow afternoon and he would then go to the Senate (upper house).     The sources said that at the cabinet meeting the Christian Democrats, senior partners in a coalition including Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans as well as the Socialists, would tell Craxi he had to resign.     If he refused to do so and insisted on a full debate they would withdraw their ministers, forcing the collapse of the government before a confidence vote, the sources said.  Reuter &#3;
