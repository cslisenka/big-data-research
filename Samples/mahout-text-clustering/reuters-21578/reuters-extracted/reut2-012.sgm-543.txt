A spokesman for General Public Utilities Corp said the company would have a statement later this morning.     Trading in the company's stock was delayed at the opening by the New York Stock Exchange, which indicated the company would make an announcement.     The spokesman would not elaborate on today's news.     Yesterday, the company said power output at its Three Mile Island unit one was cut to 81 pct of reactor power because of mineral deposits on the non-nuclear side of two steam generators.
