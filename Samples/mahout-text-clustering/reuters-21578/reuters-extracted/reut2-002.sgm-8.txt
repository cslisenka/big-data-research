FRENCH CGE GROUP LIKELY TO BE PRIVATISED IN MAY

France's state-owned Cie Generale d'Electricite (CGE) is likely to be privatised during May this year, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.     Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the group would be privatised during the course of this year, when it first announced the operation in early January, the May date is earlier than the market had expected.     As a result it will follow close on the heels of the privatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertising group <Agence Havas>.     Last month the government privatised the first of the state financial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.P>, in a floatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.     And in December the first of the industrial groups, glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain <SGEP.P>, returned to the private sector.     CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications to shipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck a deal with ITT Corp <ITT.N> to create the world's second largest telecommunications group under the Alcatel name.
