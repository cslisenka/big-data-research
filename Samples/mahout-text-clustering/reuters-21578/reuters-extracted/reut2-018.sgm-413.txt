NORANDA IN TALKS WITH BRUNSWICK LEAD-ZINC MINERS

Noranda Inc said contract talks resumed with about 1,600 unionized workers at its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zinc mine and lead smelter at Bathurst, New Brunswick.     A Noranda official said talks involved both the mine and smelter union locals, which are part of the United Steelworkers of America.     The mineworkers' contract expires July 1. They will vote on June 22 either to authorize a strike or ratify a possible contract offer. The smelter workers' pact expires July 21.     The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and 206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct zinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000 tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead.  Reuter &#3;
