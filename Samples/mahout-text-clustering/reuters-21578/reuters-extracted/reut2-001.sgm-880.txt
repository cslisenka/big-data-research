GULF STATES <GSU> ASKS FOR REQUIREMENT REMOVAL

Gulf States Utilities Co said it asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas to remove a condition that it secure a line of credit before the emergency rates can be put into effect in the Texas service area.     The commission granted it a 39.9 mln dlrs interim rate increase February five, contingent upon Gulf States obtaining a 250 mln dlr line of credit.     A motion for rehearing will be considered at as commission meeting on March 11, it said. Gulf States said it is concerned the credit line requirement will give potential lenders an advantage that would be damaging to the company.      Reuter &#3;
