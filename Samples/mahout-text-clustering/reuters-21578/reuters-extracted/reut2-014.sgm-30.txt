PORTUGUESE AIRLINE CONFIRMS AIRBUS A310 ORDER

Portugal's "flag carrier" airline TAP has confirmed an order for three Airbus Industrie <AINP.PA> A310-300 passenger aircraft, British Aerospace Plc <BAEL.L> (BAe), one of four shareholders in the international Airbus consortium, said.     BAe said in a statement TAP had also taken options on another two Airbus aircraft, either the existing A310-300 medium range craft or the long-range four-engined A340 which Airbus hopes to launch in 1992, depending on the airline's needs.     BAe said the firm order confirmed a commitment taken by TAP in January. Details of the value of the contract, delivery dates or which engine would power the aircraft were not available.
