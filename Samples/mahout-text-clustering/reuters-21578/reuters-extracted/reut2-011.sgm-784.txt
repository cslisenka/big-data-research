HAWKE CONFIRMS HE WILL NOT CALL SNAP POLL

Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he would not call snap elections although disarray within the opposition was a strong temptation to do so.     Confirming earlier comments by government officials, Hawke told reporters in Canberra: "I am confident that Labour would win an early election. I have decided, however, that the election will be held towards the end of this year or early next year.     "The Australian people want continued strong leadership and a government that will continue to guide them through difficult economic times into renewed prosperity."  REUTER &#3;
