DUTCH TO SET UP EXCHANGES WATCHDOG BODY

Stock, options and futures trading bodies are to set up the first umbrella watchdog body to improve self-regulation, officials said at a press conference.     They said a Coordinating Commission for the Securities Trade (CCE) will be set up June 1 to coordinate supervision and improve efficiency in response to legislation and competition from foreign markets, mainly London.     "The Dutch exchanges have to speak with one voice," Amsterdam Stock Exchange spokesman Boudewijn van Ittersum said, noting self-regulation could prevent harsh government supervision.     The government plans to beef up supervisory laws of financial markets during the current cabinet period to 1990, to fight malpractice like insider trading.     Under the agreement struck between securities, options and futures traders, the CCE will coordinate their independent supervisory bodies in a first step towards a single watchdog.     "The SEC is a government regulatory body, while we are developing an institution coming from the market," Westerterp said.     Van Ittersum noted despite SEC supervision, U.S. Markets had seen several bourse scandals and added "The self-regulatory function of the business is vital."     Under the markets' agreement, the official price list of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange will also include comprehensive price listings of the options exchange and the Amsterdam Gold Futures market from April 3. The latter two will end their own price list publications.  REUTER &#3;
