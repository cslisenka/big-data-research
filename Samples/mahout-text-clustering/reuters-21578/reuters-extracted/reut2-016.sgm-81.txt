SWISS BANKER SAYS COUNTRIES SEEK NEW DEBT ANSWERS

Countries meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at a variety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt, Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said.     Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMF Interim Committee today reached a consensus that a rescheduling like that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. The Mexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved six months after it started. Various members suggested other options to break the deadlock between debtor countries and their creditors, he said.     Languetin said no recommendations were agreed, but he listed some of the suggestions.     One involved individual banking systems each resolving the problem of small banks which refused to participate in reschedulings. It was this problem that had prevented completion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.     Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending', which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending' allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.     Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be forced to sign "exit bonds," prohibiting them from lending to that country again, he said.     Languetin said none of these represented a general view. But he added "People are trying to get out of the corset."  REUTER &#3;
