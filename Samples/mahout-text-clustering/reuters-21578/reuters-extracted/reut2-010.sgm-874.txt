REYNOLDS AND REYNOLDS SUED FOR THEFT OF SECRETS

<Advanced Voice Technologies Inc> said it has filed a suit against Reynolds and Reynolds Co <REYNA>, charging the company with pirating a computer-based voice messaging system for auto dealer service departments (CASI), using confidential information it received while test marketing the system for Advanced Voice.     Advanced Voice said the suit also charges that Reynolds and Reynolds advised present and potential customers of Advanced Voice not to use or buy its CASI system in an attempt to drive the Nashville, Tenn.-based company out of interstate sales to auto dealerships.     The lawsuit, filed in a Detroit U.S. District Court, seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop Reynolds and Reynolds from using or disclosing information it gained from Advanced Voice, as well as punitive and compensatory damages, Advnaced Voice said.     The company also said in its suit it had signed a confidentiality agreement with Reynolds and Reynolds before giving it business and technical information about the CASI system. Afterwards, Reynolds and Reynolds told Advanced Voice it would not distribute the CASI system, but would develop its own instead, Advanced Voice said.     "We held virtually nothing back from Reynolds and Reynolds because of our confidential relationship and the reputation of the company," Michael Frank, president of Advanced Voice, said. "They went from no backround and experience in telecommuncation equipment utilizing voice messaging technology, to their own system a year later, just two months after severing ties with us."
