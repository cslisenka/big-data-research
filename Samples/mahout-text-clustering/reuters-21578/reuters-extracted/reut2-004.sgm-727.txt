PUGET SOUND <PSNB> SETS EXTENDED VISA WARRANTIES

Puget Sound Bancorp said it is offering extended warranty service on items purchased in the U.S. with its Visa Classic or BanClub credit cards.     It said it believes it is the first bank in the nation to offer the service in connection with Visa cards.  American Express Co <AXP> has been offering extended warranties on items purchased with its credit cards since last fall.     Puget Sound said the extended warranty service doubles the manufacturer's warranty at no extra charge, with a limit of one extra year, excluding motorized vehicles and purchases carrying more than a five year warranty.
