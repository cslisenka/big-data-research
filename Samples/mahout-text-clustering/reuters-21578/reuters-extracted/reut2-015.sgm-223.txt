EC PLANS FOR CASH PAYMENTS TO FARMERS IMPEDED

Controversial plans to pay Western Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grants to leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meeting of the European Community (EC) Commission, officials said.     They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runs the Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over the proposals which some people argue could lead to national capitals having too much say in EC farm policies.     EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing paying farmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leave the land. EC member states would be permitted to top up payments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the average national farm income.     The package would also include an early retirement scheme, details of which have yet to be unveiled.     Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy -- the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted food production -- more acceptable to countries with large farming communities.     With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budget swallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in the long-run the payments would lead to considerable savings.  Reuter &#3;
