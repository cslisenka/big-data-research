ASCS TAKES STEPS TO EASE SALES OF CCC SOYBEANS

The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service announced several temporary steps to enable it to respond more quickly to the high demand for Commodity Credit Corp.-owned soybeans.     The CCC has suspended its practice of contacting storing warehousemen before selling soybeans for cash to a third party, said Collyn Peterson, deputy director in the ASCS Kansas City office.     In addition, he said, minimum quantities for sales will be 25,000 bushels, or all of a warehouse total inventory if less than that.      ASCS has added telephone lines to handle calls from those interested in buying soybeans, Peterson said.  Reuter &#3;
