STOCK CLOSURE MAY HARM H.K. REPUTATION - OFFICIALS

Stockbrokers and legislators welcomed the suspension of trading on the local market after Monday's record fall, but some said the suspension was too long and could harm the territory's reputation as a financial centre.     Announcing the suspension until next Monday, stock exchange chairman Ronald Li said earlier today "This will protect investors and allow brokers to settle a backlog of orders."     But legislator David Li, who is also managing director of the Bank of East Asia, while weloming the move, said a one-day halt would have been enough.     "I believe the exchange is over-reacting. A long suspension will damage Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and hurt foreign investors' confidence," David Li said.     Legislator Hui Yin-fat echoed this view. "What will they do if the market resumes its fall next week ?" he asked.     Legislator Lee Yu-tai said small investors would be hard-hit by the decision. He said some were paying interest on loans to purchase stock and a long suspension increased their losses.     Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said the decision was explainable, but he added, "It does seem rather a long time."     However, George Tan, assistant director of Greenwell Montagu (Far East) Ltd, said the suspension was wise. "Hong Kong is a volatile market and this will let things settle down," he said.     Other brokers agreed. "At least this gives us a bit of breathing space," said one.     John MacKenzie, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, said "I feel that it is not at all a bad thing that investors and investment mnanagers be given a breathing space."     Hong Kong's main share indicator, the Hang Seng index, fell 420.81 points to 3,362.39 on Monday - its biggest ever one-day fall in real terms.  REUTER &#3;
