GERMAN 1987 TRADE SURPLUS SEEN STAYING HIGH

West Germany's foreign trade and current account surpluses are expected to decline only slightly in 1987 from their record levels last year, economists said.     Figures released by the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed that in the first five months of the year the trade surplus grew 15.7 pct compared with the same 1986 period to 47.2 billion marks. The current account surplus rose 9.8 pct to 33.7 billion marks.     West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77 billion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.     Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-ago levels to have started biting more strongly into the nominal surpluses.     The real surpluses are already declining. The Statistics Office said after cheaper import prices were taken into consideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by more than three pct in the first five months.     Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. The government has pointed to this stronger real rise in imports than exports when rejecting international pressure to boost domestic consumption.     The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus had risen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in April and 8.1 billion in May last year.     The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marks in May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a year earlier.     Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to 43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion marks had risen only 0.8 pct in the year.     The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in a study published today that the trade surplus would probably only fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared with the 113 billion mark 1986 record.     It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61 billion marks from 77 billion.     Ifo said this reduction would only be "a small step on the way to reducing imbalances in the world economy."     Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicted a 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightly higher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion marks.     Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987 trade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current account surplus at 60 billion marks.     He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-ago period was surprising but it probably reflected calendar factors.  REUTER &#3;
