ASEAN SEES CLOSER ECONOMIC TIES WITH JAPAN

Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they expect closer economic ties with Japan.     A communique issued at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting said Asean hoped for greater Japanese investment in the region, better access for Asean products in the Japanese market and larger numbers of visiting Japanese tourists.     The ministers are due to start four days of talks tomorrow with officials of the U.S., Japan, the European Community, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, including Secretary of State George Shultz and Japan's Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.     The Asean communique noted Japan's large trade surplus, which it said would enable Tokyo to play a greater role in the economic development of ASEAN and in facilitating closer ASEAN economic cooperation.     "Japan could also help to facilitate the flow of Japanese investments to ASEAN through the provision of attractive financial assistance and incentives for its private sector," it said.     The communique also welcomed President Reagan's firm action in vetoing trade protectionist measures in the Congress.      The communique said the ASEAN ministers were concerned over the proliferation of protectionist policies, pressures and measures in developed countries, the continued depressed level of commodity prices, the instability of exchange rates and the lack of a comprehensive solution to the world debt situation.
