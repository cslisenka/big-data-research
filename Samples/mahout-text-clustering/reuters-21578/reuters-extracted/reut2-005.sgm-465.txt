CETUS <CTUS> CANCER DRUG TO GET EUROPE PATENT

Cetus Corp said the European Patent Office allowed and intends to grant the company a patent for pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations of genetically engineered Interleukin-2 analog.     Interleuken-2 is an immune modulating protein currently undergoing clinical trials in the United States and Europe for potential use in the treatment of various forms of cancer, Cetus said.     It said the allowance is the first step in the patent process.     Following allowance, the patent is published for opposition and a nine-month period begins during which interested parties have an opportunity to voice any objections to the patent, Cetus said.
