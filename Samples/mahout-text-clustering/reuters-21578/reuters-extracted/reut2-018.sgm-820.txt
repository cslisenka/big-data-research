MONSANTO <MTC> SAYS NUTRASWEET POSES NO ILLS

Monsanto Co's G.D. Searle and Co pharmaceutical division said researchers have concluded that articifical sweeteners, including aspartame which is found in Searle's NutraSweet, do not pose any significant health problems for diabetic patients.     The researchers conducted a survey of 100 diabetic patients using sweeteners from six months to 20 years. Only five pct using aspartame had health problems or discomfort, saccharine drew no complaints, and sorbitol, another sweetener, caused minor problems such as diarrhea and upset stomach in less than 25 pct of the patients, Searle said.
