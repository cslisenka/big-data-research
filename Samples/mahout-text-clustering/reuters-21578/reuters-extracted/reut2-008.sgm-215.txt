LIMITED PARTNERS SUE BOESKY

A group of limited partners has filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York against Ivan F. Boesky and others, alleging that Boesky deceived them into investing in his partnership Ivan F. Boesky and Co LP through the preparation of deceptive partnership documents.     The suit also names as defendants <Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc>, investment banker for the partnership, law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson and its attorney Stephen Fraidin, and financial services company Seligmann Harris and Co, as well as former Drexel investment bankers Dennis A. Levine and Martin A. Siegel.                                Levine and Siegel have already pleaded guilty to insider trading violations, as has Boesky.     The suit alleges that partnership documents prepared by the law firm were misleading because they failed to disclose the criminal violations to which Boesky later pleaded guilty. Seligman helped recruit investors to the partnership, according to the suit.     The suit said the papers failed to disclose Drexel's financial interests in the partnership.  It also said Boesky failed to meet a pledge to invest at least 20 mln dlrs in the partnership.     The suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages from the partnership and Boesky and damages from Fried, Frank and Fraidin.     The plaintiffs include Home Group Inc <HME>, Lincoln National Corp <LNC>, a number of other institutional investors and recently-named Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS> asset management unit senior advisor Lewis Lehrman.
