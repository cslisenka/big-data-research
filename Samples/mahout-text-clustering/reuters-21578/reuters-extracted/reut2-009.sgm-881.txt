LIBYA ABANDONS CHAD STRONGHOLD AFTER DEFEATS

Libyan troops are hastily evacuating their last important stronghold in northern Chad, leaving the key desert oasis undefended against advancing Chad government troops, military and diplomatic sources said.     They said a Libyan force of some 3,000 men was abandoning the oasis of Faya-Largeau but added that severe sand storms across Chad could be delaying the pull out and an expected government strike on the town.     Swirling clouds of sand, which have closed the capital of N'Djamena to commercial flights for two days, have sharply reduced visibility and made it difficult to determine the exact situation around Faya, French military officials said.     The hurried Libyan evacuation, which started yesterday morning, follows the capture on Sunday of Libya's best-defended and vitally important air base at Ouadi Doum, 145 kms (90 miles) northeast of Faya.     The fall of Ouadi Doum, which Chad said cost 1,269 Libyan lives, deprived Libya of its only hard surface runway in Chad capable of taking Soviet-made bombers and transport planes and left Faya-Largeau isolated and encircled by government troops.     Libyan forces are reported to have blown up stocks of fuel and ammunition on Tuesday night before starting to flee northwards towards the Tibesti mountain region, which adjoins Libya's southern border.
