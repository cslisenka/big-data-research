SALOMON BROTHERS HAS HARCOURT <HBJ> DEBENTURES

Salomon Brothers Inc said it has acquired 21,978 convertible subordinated debentures of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, which it says could be converted into 21,978,000 common shares.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York brokerage firm said it bought the debentures, which have a face value of 1,000 dlrs each, in May and June as a regular part of its investment and arbitrage activities.     The conversion rights of the debentures are the subject of a Florida court case, in which Salomon Brothers said it has also intervened.     Salomon Brothers said it rejects Hartcourt's position that the debentures are not convertible into stock as of June 9.     It said it would leave open a range of options regarding the debentures, including buying more, selling some or all of their current stake in the market or in negotiated deals, talking with other Harcourt security holders, surrendering the debentures if there were a merger or tender offer or converting them into stock.     Salomon said it would have a 35.8 pct stake in Harcourt, based on 39.4 mln shares outstanding, if it converted the debentures into 21,978,000 common shares. The percentage is based on the current outstanding plus the amount of stock that would be issued in a conversion.     But Salomon said its stake in Harcourt's common stock would be lower if other debentureholders converted their securities into stock. It says it has no idea of the total number of debentures outstanding.     Harcourt has said that Salomon and Mutual Shares Corp, a New York investment firm, hold a combined total of 30 mln dlrs of debentures.     Harcourt announced a recapitalization plan last month to ward off a takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.      Reuter &#3;
