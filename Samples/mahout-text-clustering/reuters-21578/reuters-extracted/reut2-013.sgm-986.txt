LONDON GOLD FIXED AT 418.50 DLRS THIS AFTERNOON

Gold bullion eased to an afternoon fix of 418.50 dlrs, 258.653 stg, an ounce in sympathy with lower values on Comex, dealers said.     The market remained fairly quiet, however, and was still being overshadowed by silver.  After opening slightly lower at 421.90/422.40, compared with last night's close of 422.50/423, the market eased to a morning fix of 419.80 as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio, selling gold and buying silver.     Platinum was fixed this afternoon at 566.35 dlrs, slightly above the morning setting of 565.75.  REUTER &#3;
