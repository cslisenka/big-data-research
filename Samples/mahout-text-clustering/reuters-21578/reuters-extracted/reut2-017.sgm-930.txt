CNP OF PORTUGAL MANDATES 250 MLN DLR LOAN

Companhia Nacional de Petroquimica EP (CNP), the Portugese state-owned oil refinery and petrochemicals company, has awarded a mandate to Bank of America International Ltd and Manufacturers Hanover Ltd to arrange a 250 mln dlr loan, banking sources said.     The loan will be for eight years and proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt.     Interest will be at 12.5 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the first four years, with the margin rising to 15 basis points in the last four years. No other fees were immediately available.     Bankers noted that CNP has faced significant financial problems over the past year as a result of investments in areas which proved to be unprofitable.     Portugal is attempting to maintain its position in the petrochemical industry and is undertaking a restructuring of CNP, which involves the divestment of certain unprofitable assets.     Partly because of these problems, the new loan carries a "letter of support and assumption" under which the Republic would assume the obligations of CNP should it be unable to meet any payments or cease to exist.     Furthermore, bankers noted that this financing covers all of CNP's existing debt, some of which was state-guaranteed but some of which was not.     The existing loans had maturities of about seven to 10 years and carried interest margins of between 3/8 and 5/8 pct.     By consolidating the loans and covering them with the Republic's support, the borrower was able to obtain a reduction in the margins on the new loan, bankers said.  REUTER &#3;
