BRAZIL NEEDS MORE EXTERNAL FINANCING - VOLCKER

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that Brazil will need more external financing to work its way out of its current debt crisis than earlier anticipated.     "External financing will have to be found in larger amounts than anticipated a few months ago," he said in remarks prepared for a business leader luncheon.     Volcker said that financing, however, must take place along with policies that come to grips with Brazil's internal difficulties.     Volcker said Brazil has a lot more negotiating to do with international institutions and its bank creditors but added that a solution to its financial problems can be found.     "The predicate for these negotiations has to be effective policy at home (in Brazil)," Volcker told reporters.     "Brazil, it seems to me, has a strong self interest in restoring a more normal situation (on interest payments) so that it can continue to participate freely in trade with the rest of the world - and it has so indicated," Volcker said in his prepared remarks.     Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt last month.  Reuter &#3;
