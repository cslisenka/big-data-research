MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE IRVING <V> DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 950 mln dlrs of debt of Irving Bank Corp and lead bank Irving Trust Co.     The rating agency said it will assess Irving's ability to substantially improve operating results in increasingly competitive markets. The review will also focus on Irving's shifting risk profile in light of its modest capital base.     Moody's cited the bank's significant exposure to less developed countries. Under review are the parent's Aa-3 senior debt, A-1 subordinated debt and Aa-3 preferred stock and Irving Trust's Aa-1 long-term desposits and letters of credit.  Reuter &#3;
