ATT <T> INTRODUCES NEW COMPUTER PRODUCTS

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it has introduced a variety of new computer hardware, software and networking products for corporate use.     The company introduced the 3B2/600 minicomputer, which can support up to 64 simultaneous users. The computer is the latest addition to ATT's family of Unix system-based minicomputers, it said.     The 3B2/600 costs 46,500 dlrs and will be available in May 1987, ATT said.     The company also announced a host of peripherals to enhance the data storage capacity of the minicomputer and other products.     In addition, ATT cut prices 17 to 25 pct on its 3B2/310 and 400 computers and 12 to 24 pct on its 3B15 computer model 301 and 401, it said.     Among the developments announced today is ATT's use of the Small Computer Systems Interface, SCSI, an emerging industry standard for communications between computers and peripherals.     The SCSI-based peripherals introduced include a 3B2 host adaptor package for 2,000 dlrs, new configurations for the 3B2/400, available for 23,000 to 26,000 dlrs, and expansion modules priced at 20,700 dlrs. The peripherals will also be available in May, it said.     Other products introduced include document exchange products, printers, and other peripherals.     Most are to be available beginning this spring and summer, although some of the document exchange products are available now, ATT said.  Reuter &#3;
