PORK BELLY FUTURES START HIGHER, THEN EASE

Pork belly (bacon) futures ran up for gains of 0.55 to 0.30 cent at the start and then eased to trade 0.15 cent lower to 0.15 higher in early dealings.     Active local carryover demand and mixed commission house buying lifted futures at the start. Higher cash hog markets on light runs and spillover from other meat pits prompted support, traders said.     However, locals turned sellers along with Saul Stone and Paine Webber and prices turned mostly lower. Trimming of gains in other pits and expectations of possibly negative out of town storage report this afternoon weighed on the market. Guesses on the report ranged from in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs with most indications on the high side, they noted.  Reuter &#3;
