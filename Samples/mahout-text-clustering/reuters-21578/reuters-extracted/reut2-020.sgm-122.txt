U.K. STOCKBROKERS DENY RUMOURED HEAVY LOSSES

Rumours of heavy trading losses at two large U.K. Brokerage firms, Warburg Securities and Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), are not true, spokesmen for the firms said.     Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, joint chairman of Warburg Securities, told Reuters the firm lost about 4.7 mln stg on Monday. This was equal to the profit made last week. He had no estimate for today's outcome.     BZW spokesman Geoffrey Kelly described the rumours as "absolute rubbish." He added "We lost a bit, but who didn't?"     Warburg Securities is part of <S.G. Warburg Group Plc>. BZW is owned by Barclays Plc <BCS.L>.     Rumours of trading losses among London brokers have been circulating since the market collapse gained fresh momentum.     Stock Exchange chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison has been unavailable for comment this morning.     The London market has fallen almost 24 pct since Thursday.  Reuter &#3;
