MIDAM EXCHANGE MOVES TO CBT FLOOR, EXPANDS HOURS

The MidAmerica Commodity Exchange (MIDAM) moved from the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor to a room off the main trading floors of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) today and expanded trading hours for Treasury-bond futures to 0720 to 1515 CST.     CBT bond futures continue to trade from 0800 to 1400 CST.     The MIDAM was founded last century as the Chicago Open Board of Trade as a grain exchange and has since expanded to include smaller contracts of livestock, currencies, metals and financial futures.     MIDAM traders said the new CBT facilities worked well today, offering more inter-market spread opportunities in two trading pits than on the old floor which they believed was too large for the volume of trade.
