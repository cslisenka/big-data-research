FORMER BROKER PLEADS GUILTY IN U.S. TAX SCHEME

A former vice president of Painewebber Inc pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to charges he conspired to launder over 700,000 dlrs in cash from investors.     Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebber's highest paid broker between 1982-86, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records.     Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year, admitted he received cash from various clients, and converted the funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.     Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactions except for the commissions he received.     U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 for sentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on each count and 260,000 dlrs in fines.     Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentified supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currency transaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cash transactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to the IRS.     David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case, said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000 dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amounts under 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on several different days.     Outside of Court, Eder's lawyer, Milton Gould, said his client was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insider trading scandel. Rather, Gould said, "Eder accomodated some wealthy customers (who wanted to avoid taxes)."   Reuter &#3;
