BANK OF AMERICA <BAC> SEEKS TO QUIT PARAGUAY

BankAmerica Corp is seeking a buyer for its branch in Asuncion, Paraguay, a spokesman in Miami for the bank holding company said.     "We are in ongoing negotiations for the sale of our Paraguay operations," the spokesman said. He declined to name the possible buyer.     A sale of the Paraguayan operations, which employ about 80 people, would be consistent with Bank of America's strategy of concentrating its international efforts on wholesale banking, he added. The bank has sold operations in a number of countries recently, including Italy and Sri Lanka.  Reuter &#3;
