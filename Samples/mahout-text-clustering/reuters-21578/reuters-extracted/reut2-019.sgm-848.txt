ALLIS-CHALMERS <AH> LISTS MAIN CREDITORS

Court documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court by attorneys for Allis-Chalmers Corp <AH> listed Equitable Life Assurance Co as one of the largest creditors.     According to the court papers, Equitable was owed a total of 468,859 dlrs. Other creditors included Connecticut General Life Insurance Co, owed 192,520 dlrs, and New York Life Insurance Co, owed 146,553 dlrs.     The list of unsecured creditors was headed by KHIC America Corp, of Rutheford, New Jersey, which was owed 663,950 dlrs.         Second on the list of unsecured creditors was a group of paving contractors owed 600,000 dlrs.     Manville Corp <MAN> was third with 471,157 dlrs owed.     Allis-Chalmers said that on Dec 31 the unfunded pension liabilities totaled 44 mln dlrs.     It said that it intended to carry out a reorganization by disposing of businesses that do not contribute adequately to cash flow. The company said it plans to eliminate unprofitable product lines and emphasize more profitable product lines.     Allis-Chalmers said it intended to obtain workforce reductions and seek monetary and other concessions from salaried and hourly employees.     It said it will eliminate operations of facilities that are marginal performers. The company said it plans to discontinue burdensome contracts and leases as well as collective bargaining agreements.     The company said it believes creditors will realize more from a reorganization than from a liquidation.     The documents said Allis-Chalmers has suffered substantial losses since 1981 due to sales declines caused by fierce competition and a sluggish global economy.     It said a restructuring plan, which it has already  instituted, adversely affected cash flow because certain costs including product liability and retiree medical and pension costs continued as before despite a reduction in the size of its business.
