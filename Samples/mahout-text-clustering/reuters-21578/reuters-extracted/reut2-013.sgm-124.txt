Mellon Bank Corp said a shareholder filed a class action suit in Philadelphia in light of the precipitous decline in Mellon's stock on the New York Stock Exchange.     Mellon's stock fell 3-1/2 to 40-7/8 today after plunging 6-1/4 yesterday after the bank holding company reported its first loss in its 118 years, according to the shareholder, John Paul Decker.     Yesterday, the company said it expected to report a first quarter loss of between 55 mln and 65 mln dlrs and its intention to reduce the quarterly dividend.     The shareholder charges that Mellon and its senior officers failed to disclose the company's true financial condition during the class period, between February 1, 1985 and April 2, 1987      Mellon said it had no comment because it had not yet seen the suit.
