JAMAICA WILL MAKE NEW DRAWING UNDER IMF PROGRAM

Jamaica will draw down 40.9 mln Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the International Monetary Fund following IMF approval yesterday of a new credit program for the island, the government announced.     Financing from the compensatory facility is meant to offset losses in export earnings and does not carry the same conditions attached to other IMF loans.     The government will also receive 85 mln SDRs under a new stand-by agreement. The new credit agreement signed in January was originally to last 15 months, but the government now says it will go for one year beginning this month.  REUTER &#3;
