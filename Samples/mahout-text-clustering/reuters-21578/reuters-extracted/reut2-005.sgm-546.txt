<RAPHOLZ SILVER INC>TO STUDY MINE WATER PROJECT

Rapholz Silver Inc said <R and M Construction Services>, Montrose, Colo., will conduct a study on using water discharge from Rapholz's Carbonero's Mine to produce hydroelectric power.     R and M will also seek to obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for construction of a hydroelectricity plant at the mine, Rapholz said.     The company added, however, that it will not use its own capital to build the plant. If the study shows construction is feasible, it said it will try to form a joint venture with firms experienced in the hydroelectricity business.  Reuter &#3;
