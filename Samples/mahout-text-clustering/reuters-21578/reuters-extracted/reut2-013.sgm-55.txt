IRAQ SAYS ITS FORCES SINK THREE IRANIAN VESSELS

Iraq said its forces sank three Iranian boats which tried to approach its disused deep water oil terminal in the northern Gulf today.     A military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi news agency, said other Iranian boats fled. He did not identify the vessels.     Iraq's major oil outlets in the northern Gulf were closed shortly after the war with Iran started in late 1980.  Reuter &#3;
