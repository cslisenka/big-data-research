ECUADOR INDUSTRY AND TRADE MINISTER RESIGNS

Ecuador's Minister for Industry and Trade resigned today, but denied he was responding to recent protests against a new austerity program that went into effect after a devastating earthquake.     Xavier Neira, an economist, told reporters he was stepping down for personal reasons and would return to his private business as a foreign trade consultant.     He defended government austerity measures adopted last Friday as a "necessary antidote" to the losses from the March five quake which cost an estimated one billion dlrs in damage and left 1,000 people dead or missing.      Ecuadoran unions have called for a general strike next Wednesday to press for a suspension of the belt-tightening measures, which include a rise in gasoline prices of up to 80 pct, budget cuts of up 10 pct and a government hiring freeze.     Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has been forced to halt shipments of crude, its main export, for about five months until it repairs a pipeline that ruptured as a result of the quake.
