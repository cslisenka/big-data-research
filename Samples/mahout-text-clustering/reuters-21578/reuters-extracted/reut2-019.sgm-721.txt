U.S. CAR OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING IN 3RD QTR

U.S. car production is scheduled to drop by 10.4 pct to about 1.47 mln in the third quarter from last year's 1.63 mln as domestic automakers react to a drop in sales from last year's record levels, trade paper Automotive News said.     Automotive News said General Motors Corp <GM> has slashed its planned car production by 12.6 pct from last year's third quarter totals while Ford Motor Co <F> is scheduling its plants to build 5.4 pct fewer cars and Chrysler Corp <C> will be off 18.4 pct.     But the paper quoted analysts as saying the production should be cut by at least 200,000 more units to avoid excessive inventory build-up in view of a relatively soft market for new cars.     Through June 20, sales of new domestic-built cars are off 11.9 pct from last year's levels. Only Ford among the Detroit Big Three is enjoying a sales gain.     GM and Ford may be working to stockpile cars despite the market conditions because of the prospect of a strike in September by the United Automobile Workers union, analysts said.  Reuter &#3;
