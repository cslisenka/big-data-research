TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES STOCK TRANSACTION TAX

Treasury Secretary James Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.     "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take," Baker said in an interview with Cable News Network.
