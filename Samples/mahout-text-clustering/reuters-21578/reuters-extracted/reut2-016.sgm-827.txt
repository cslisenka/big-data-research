MORTON-THIOKOL EMPLOYEES ALLEGE FRAUD, TV SAYS

Employees of Morton Thiokol Inc <MTI.N> have gone to the FBI with allegations of fraud by the firm in the manufacture of booster rockets blamed for the 1986 Challenger explosion, ABC News reported.     According to the report, some Morton Thiokol employees went to the FBI in Salt Lake City, Utah, with their allegations last January 15.     An FBI criminal investigation into Morton Thiokol began in late January, although FBI officials have refused to confirm whether the probe was related to the Challenger disaster.     FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney refused to discuss the report today, saying FBI officials could not comment about current  investigations.     The space shuttle Challenger exploded after takeoff Jan 28, 1986, when the temperature at the Florida launch site was 20 degrees below that specified for the O-rings that hold the solid-rocket boosters together.     The rings failed and all seven shuttle astronauts died in the explosion.     Morton Thiokol, based in Chicago, built the Challenger's boosters in its Utah facility.     The allegations by the employees follow similar charges by former Morton-Thiokol engineer Roger Boisjoly, who has filed two lawsuits alleging criminal fraud against his former employer.
