TANZANIA OUTLINES NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN

Tanzania will need about 1.2 billion dlrs of hard currency investment to support its 1987-1992 five-year plan which begins in July, Minister of State for Finance Damas Mbogoro said.     He told an economic planning seminar in the northern town of Arusha yesterday that the new plan would concentrate on rehabilitating Tanzania's existing infrastructure, with a minimum of investment in new development projects.     The aim is to boost agricultural production by five pct a year and industrial output by 6.4 pct, he said.  Reuter &#3;
