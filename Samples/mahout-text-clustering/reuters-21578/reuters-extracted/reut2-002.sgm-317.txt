Orient-Express Hotels Inc said it reached agreement in principle to sell four hotels and the SeaCo Business Park near Houston for a total consideration of 54 mln dlrs, payable 51.8 mln dlrs in cash.     The company said it is expected the sales will be concluded within 90 days. The purchasers have asked not to be identified until the completion of the sales, it added.

It said the Lodge at Vail, Colo., will be sold and leased back for 10 years with tghe option to extend the lease.     The company said the Royal York hotel in York, England, and the Lochalsh Hotel at the Kyle of Lochalsh in Scotland will be sold to a British hotels group and Orient-Express will have no further involvement in these properties.
