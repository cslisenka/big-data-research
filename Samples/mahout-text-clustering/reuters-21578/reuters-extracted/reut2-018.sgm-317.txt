LILLY <LLY> TO PAY ROCHE ROYALTIES ON HUMATROPE

Hoffman-LaRoche Inc said Eli Lilly and Co Inc will pay it royalties on the sale of Lilly's human growth hormone, Humatrope, as part of an earlier-reported licensing agreement between the companies.     Hoffman-La Roche spokesman John Doorley declined to disclose the amount of the royalty payments.     "Lilly has taken the position of respecting our patent by paying us roylaties," said Doorley. "We are hopeful that other companies will respect that position," he said.     Roche is the licensee of a Hormone Research Foundation patent for a synthetic version of human growth hormone.         Last September, Roche and the Foundation sued Genetech Inc <GENE> alleging Genetech's product, Protropin, a human growth hormone, infringed on Hoffman's patent for the hormone.     Last year Genetech's sales of Protropin were about 35 mln dlrs. David Saks, drug analyst with Morgan Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner in New York, said Genetech's and Lilly's product can each bring in about 50 mln dlrs in sales annually.     Other companies developing human growth hormone include Biotechnology General Corp. Roche's Doorley said the company had at one time started developing a growth hormone but decided to put its efforts into other products.  Reuter &#3;
