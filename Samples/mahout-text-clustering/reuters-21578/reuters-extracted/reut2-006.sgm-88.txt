PERRY DRUG <PDS> SLOWS EXPANSION

Perry Drug Stores Inc, which two weeks ago reported sharply lower first quarter earnings, plans to slow its expansion to five to six pct annually from 15 pct last year, Chairman Jack A. Robinson told Reuters.     Robinson said after the company's annual meeting that Perry also would slow its acquisition program, through which the company has moved into the auto parts business.      Although Robinson would not make a specific earnings forecast, he said "We expect to regain our earnings momentum in the second half of the current fiscal year, ending October 31."     Perry Drug earned 13 cts a share in its first quarter this year. It made 11 cts a share in last year's second half, down from 51 cts in the 1985 second half.  Reuter &#3;
