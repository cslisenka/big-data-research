IRAN GAIN IN IRAQI TERRITORY SEEN INSIGNIFICANT

The United States today dismissed as insignificant gains by Iranian forces in Northern Iraq.     State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters the gain in an area around Mount Kardemand had no signifficant bearing on the seven-year-old Gulf war.     Press reports from the region said the Iranian push had placed its forces to move against the road to Rawandiz, some 60 miles (96 KM) north of major Iraqi oil fields and refineries and the Turkish-Iraqi pipeline at Kirkuk.     But Redman said the Iranian push "took place in an area of Iraqi territory which is of little strategic value".     "Actual possession of the area has seesawed between Iraq and Iran since the early days of the war," he added.     The Iranian push that captured the territory nearly two weeks ago and reported in the American press this weekend, was not a major offensive, Redman said.      Reuter &#3;
