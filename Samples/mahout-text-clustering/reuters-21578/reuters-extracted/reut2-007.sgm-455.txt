SEC CONTINUES MARKET MANIPULATION INVESTIGATION

The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing an investigation of the practice of "parking" stocks, said Richard Murphy, a lawyer with the SEC enforcement division.     Earlier, the SEC settled civil charges against Boyd Jefferies and Jefferies Group Inc, which allege market manipulation and the parking of stocks, a practice where stock is held by one person or firm while it is actually under the control of someone else.     Murphy told reporters others are being investigated for parking stocks.  Reuter &#3;
