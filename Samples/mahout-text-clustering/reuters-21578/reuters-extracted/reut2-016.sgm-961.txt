DOCKERS' STRIKE HITS CANARY ISLAND PORT

Striking dockers brought the Canary Island port of Las Palmas to a halt today but called off a stoppage in Spain's main port of Barcelona after winning the reinstatement of a sacked worker, port officials said.     They said about 15 freighters were affected in Las Palmas as talks on dockers' demands to reinstate five workers went on. A stoppage was also called off in Santa Cruz, on Tenerife.     Union sources said the strike would continue in Las Palmas tomorrow and would spread unless the demands were met, with a strike threatened in all ports for two hours on Thursday, four on Friday, six on Saturday and every other hour from May 4-11.
