STERIVET <STVTF.O> HAS FDA REVIEW STATUS

Sterivet Laboratories Ltd said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted expedited review status for its proprietary drug Navicon.     The company said future marketability of Navicon in the U.S. will be greatly facilitated by receiving expedited review status and the company should achieve wide penetration once FDA approval for the drug is received.     Navicon is a drug designed to treat navicular disease which affects the feet of one-third of all horses aged between five and 15.  Reuter &#3;
