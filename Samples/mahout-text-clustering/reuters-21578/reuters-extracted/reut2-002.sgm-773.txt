MELLON BANK <MEL> SELLS FIVE-YEAR DEPOSIT NOTES

Mellon Bank Corp is raising 150 mln dlrs via an offering of deposit notes due 1992 with a 7.45 pct coupon and par pricing, said sole manager First Boston Corp.     That is 73 basis points more than the yield of comparable Treasury securities.     The issue has a one-time call after three years, First Boston detailed. If Mellon does not redeem the notes at that time, they will be non-callable to maturity.     Moody's Investors Service Inc rates the debt Aa-2 and Standard and Poor's Corp rates it AA.  Reuter &#3;
