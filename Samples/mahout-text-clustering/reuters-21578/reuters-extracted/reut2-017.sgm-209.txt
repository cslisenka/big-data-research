BUNDESBANK INTERVENES IN TOKYO VIA BANK OF JAPAN

The Bundesbank intervened in the Tokyo foreign exchange market to buy a small amount of dollars against marks through the Bank of Japan, dealers said.     The West German central bank bought dollars when the dollar was at about 1.7770-80 marks. Dealers' estimates of the intervention amount varied from 100 mln to one billion dlrs.     Some dealers said the Bank of Japan appeared to have undertaken small-lot mark-selling intervention on its own account.  REUTER &#3;
