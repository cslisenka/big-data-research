IOWA BANK BECOMES 34TH TO FAIL THIS YEAR

The deposits of the failed First State Bank of Rockford, Iowa, were assumed by First Security Bank and Trust Co of Charles City, Iowa, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.     The FDIC said it acted after First State, with 15.1 mln dlrs in assets, was closed today by Iowa Banking Superintendent William Bernau. It was the 34th U.S. bank to fail this year, and the 12th agricultural bank.     To facilitate the transaction, the FDIC said it would pay the assuming bank 4.1 mln dlrs and retain assets of the failed bank valued at 4.8 mln dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
