SPANISH PRIVATE BANK WORKERS STRIKE

Most private banks in central Madrid and Barcelona closed as Spanish bank staff went on strike for more pay, union officials and employers said.     Union officials said there was at least partial response to the strike call in the rest of Spain. But a spokesman for the employers' Banks Association said banks in many towns were working almost normally.     Unions called the strike today and tomorrow morning to press for shorter working hours and an eight pct pay increase. Employers offered a 4.75 pct wage increase last month.  REUTER &#3;
