GEMCRAFT <GEMH.O> TO BUY ABOUT 130,000 SHARES

Gemcraft Inc told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company and its principal shareholders will repurchase about 130,000 shares of its common stock.     The company's portion of the repurchase obligation equals about 800,000 dlrs, which the company said it plans to record as a capital transaction in 1987.     Originally, Gemcraft said it estimated that it could be required to buy as many as 300,000 shares for about 3.0 mln dlrs.     Gemcraft originally estimated its portion of trading losses could total as much as 600,000 dlrs and recorded a charge to earnings in that amount in the 1986 fourth quarter.     The company said it plans to provide an after-tax credit to income of about 200,000 dlrs in the second quarter of 1987 to reflect this difference.     Gemcraft also told shareholders it sees a profitable 1987 second quarter. In the year-ago period, it reported earnings of 908,000 dlrs, or 6 cts a share on sales of 88.8 mln.  Reuter &#3;
