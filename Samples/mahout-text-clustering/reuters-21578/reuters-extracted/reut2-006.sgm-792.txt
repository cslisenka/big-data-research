U.S. AGENCY FINDS RAILROAD REVENUES INADEQUATE

The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service, concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroads had adequate revenues in 1985.     The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely to look favorably on requests for rate increases by these railroads made during the current year.     Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to rate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.     Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by the government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate if it finds it to be unreasonable.     In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry and shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of five commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.     "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns have fallen well short of their cost of capital, however defined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted with the majority.     The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the highest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and Ohio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3 pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and the Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.     Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the Delaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the Western Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.  Reuter &#3;
