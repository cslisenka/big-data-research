LIVE HOG FUTURES TRIM SHARP GAINS AT CLOSE

Live Hog futures ran up for sharp gains after midsession before slipping late to close 0.82 cent higher to 0.02 lower. Only February posted a loss while April and June paced the gain and April ended at 50.65 cents.     Futures ran up early as demand prompted by strong live markets, light hog runs and the discount of futures to cash sparked technical buying. April ran up as much as 1.42 cents above its previous level before profit-taking developed, traders said.     Gains in cash hogs reflected reduced farmer marketings as  they took to the fields for the start of spring activities. The strength in live also offset a sharp break in cash ham prices. The break in hams was expected as Easter buying came to an end, they added.  Reuter &#3;
