NORDBANKEN POSTPONES PLANNED AUCTION OF FERMENTA SHARES

Sweden's Nordbanken banking group  said it would postpone indefinitely its planned auction on Monday of 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by Fermenta's <FRMS ST> founder and former chief executive Reefat el-Sayed.     A statement cited Fermenta's financial position as the main reason for delay. The company's 1986 deficit had earlier been estimated at 136 mln crowns, but that was revised at an extraordinary shareholders meeting last Monday to half a billion crowns. The company said at the meeting a planned new share issue would not be launched but that another, estimated to raise 580 mln crowns, was scheduled for April.     Nordbanken said the auction was the natural result of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan. Although it expected to buy the shares back itself, it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for them.     Nordbanken loaned 200 mln crowns to Reefat el-Sayed privately and is Fermenta's largest creditor with loans of l55 mln crowns.     It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance Fermenta 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems.  REUTER &#3;
