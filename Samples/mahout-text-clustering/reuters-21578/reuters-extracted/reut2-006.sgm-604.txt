ATT <T> TO REDEEM 15.5 MLN PREFERRED SHARES

American Telephone and Telegraph said that, effective May 1, it will spend 775 mln dlrs to redeem  15.5 mln shares of the outstanding 16.7 mln shares in two publicly held preferred stock issues.     The two issues have a stated value of 50 dlrs per share and pay 3.64 dlrs and 3.74 dlrs in annual dividends, respectively, ATT said, adding it will redeem 7.9 mln shares of its 3.64 dlrs pfd stock and 7.6 mln shares of its 3.74 dlrs pfd stock.     ATT's corporate vice president and treasurer S. Lawrence Prendergast said ATT expects to finance the redemption with cash.     "The redemption is part of our continuing efforts to reduce ATT's financial risk," Predergast said. "In 1986 we reduced our outstanding debt and preferred stock by a total of 1.6 billion dlrs. As a result our annual fixed charges were reduced by almost 200 mln dlrs and our ability to service our existing debt was strengthened."     The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50 mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debt and preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrs since the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.     ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem 300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optional redemption of additional shares.     The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64 dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln shares of the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrs per share.     ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferred shares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.     After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will remain outstanding, ATT said.     ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lot according to the issues' terms, adding that the record date for determining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.     The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for all preferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normal way to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.     ATT said no transfer of the shares being called for redemption will be made after March 26, 1987 and the transfer books will close for those shares on that date.     American Transtech Inc, the paying agent for the shares,  will send notices of the redemption on March 30 to the preferred shareholders who were selected by lot, ATT said.  Reuter &#3;
