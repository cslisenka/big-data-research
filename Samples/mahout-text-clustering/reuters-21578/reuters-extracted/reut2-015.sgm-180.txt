MUNSON <MGEO> GETS PROJECT FINANCING

Munson Geothermal Inc said it received the necessary financing to complete construction work at its Brady Hot Springs facility and begin commercial delivery of geothermally produced electricity to Sierra Pacific Resouces Corp <SRP> by July this year.     Munson has a 30-year contract which calls for it to supply Sierra Pacific with about 23.5 megawatts of electricity per year, a spokesman said.     Munson, a wholesale electric utility, said the financing consists of a 1.25 mln dlr credit agreement with a division of Foster Oilfield Co of Houston.     Trading in Munson's stock was halted earlier, news pending. It last traded at a bid of 2-3/8 and an offer of 2-1/2.     In addition, Munson said that since closing its 1.2 mln dlr limited partnership at Brady in December 1986, the company has raised about 500,000 dlrs through private placements with qualified investors.     The funds will be used to help finance commercial startup of the Brady facility, Munson also said.  Reuter &#3;
