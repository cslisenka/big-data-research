FIRST REPUBLIC <FRB> ADDS TO LOAN LOSS RESERVE

First RepublicBank Corp said it will add 325 mln dlrs to its loan loss reserve for the second quarter.      The company said the move, which is being made to cover loans to developed countries, will result in a loss of around 313 mln dlrs in the second quarter ending June 30.     First RepublicBank Corp said the increase in its loan loss reserve will lead to a loss for the full year. Figures for last year are unavailable as the bank was formed in June this year after a merger of two Dallas-based banks, RepublicBank Corp and InterFirst Corp.     The company said the 325 mln dlrs provision will increase its reserve to 1.1 billion dlrs, out of which it will allocate 275 mln dlrs to cover its loans to 18 developing countries.     The company said it took the action in light of recent action taken by other major banking organizations on developing country loans.  Reuter &#3;
