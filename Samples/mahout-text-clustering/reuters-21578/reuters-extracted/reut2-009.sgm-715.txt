SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WOMEN

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld affirmative action programmes designed to promote women in the workplace yesterday, handing President Reagan's civil rights policy a major defeat.     Tn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the civil rights laws allow employers to take the gender of workers into account to improve female representation in the workforce.     The Reagan administration had charged that affirmative action is reverse discrimination.     The case involved the 1980 promotion of a female road yard clerk, Diane Joyce, over a more qualified male, Paul Johnson.  REUTER &#3;
