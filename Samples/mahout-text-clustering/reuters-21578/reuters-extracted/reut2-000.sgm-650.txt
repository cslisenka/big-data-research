NACCO INDUSTRIES <NC> UNIT TO BE SOLD

Nacco Industries Inc said a group of utilities, called the Capco group, has taken actions to exercise its option to acquire the Quarto Mining Co unit of Nacco's North American Coal Co.     The purchase would be for about 10 mln dlrs, and would, if completed, generate a substantial capital gain for Nacco, the company said. The price is equal to the value of coal reserves contributed to Quarto by North American Coal.     In 1986, Quarto produced about 3.6 mln tons of coal and net earnings of 5.9 mln dlrs, Nacco said.     Capco is a group of utilities that includes Ohio Edison Co <OEC> and Centerior Energy Corp <CX>.
