FRANCE PROTESTS OVER CANADA'S FISHING BAN

France today protested over Canada's decision to declare its ports off limits to French fishing vessels and bar further fishing by France off Newfoundland.     A foreign ministry statement described yesterday's decision by Canada as "unjustified and contrary to international law and commitments made by Canada," and called on Ottawa authorities to reexamin their position.     Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday said that any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, off the south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.     "The French government strongly protests against the closing of Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against the fishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank," the ministry statement added.     The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latest episode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have a negative effect on fishing negotiations currently held between Ottawa and Paris.     Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their 6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.     In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishing accord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing France to increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.     Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to refer differences over a maritime boundary zone near the French islands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to international arbitration.  Reuter &#3;
