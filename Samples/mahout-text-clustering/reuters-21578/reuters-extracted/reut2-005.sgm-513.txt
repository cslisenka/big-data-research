AEROSPATIALE STUDYING HIGH-SPEED AIRLINER

France's state-owned Aerospatiale is working on designs for a hypersonic plane to fly 150 passengers at five times the speed of sound, and plans to unveil computer studies at the Paris air show in June, a company spokesman said.     The plane, which is similar in concept to the Orient Express project announced by President Reagan last year, would have four ram-jet motors, lacking the moving parts of conventional turbo-jet engines, and each having 30 tonnes of thrust.     It would cruise at an altitude of up to 30,000 metres, around three times higher than conventional aircraft and nearly twice as high as the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet.     With a range of 12,000 km it would be capable of flying from Paris to New York in one hour, compared with three hours taken by Concorde, and Paris to Tokyo in two hours.     The aircraft could reach speeds in excess of 5,000 km an hour.     The Aerospatiale spokesman said its research scientists had been working on the project for about two years, drawing on the experience it gained from Concorde as well as experience in heat-resistant materials needed on high-speed aircraft which it has developed from building French nuclear missiles.
