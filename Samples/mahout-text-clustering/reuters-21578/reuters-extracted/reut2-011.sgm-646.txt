U.S. SENATE BILL SEEN HAMPERING FOREIGN BANKS

The recently passed Senate bank bill, which called for a one-year freeze on new bank services and barred the creation of limited service banks, could hamper foreign banks' operations here, said Lawrence Uhlick, incoming executive director of the Institute of Foreign Bankers Inc.     "The language is very unclear and very troublesome," he told a press briefing.     He said the institute, which represents 230 international banks operating in the U.S., would lobby for changes in the final version of the bank bill, which still has to go through the House and the conference process before becoming law.
