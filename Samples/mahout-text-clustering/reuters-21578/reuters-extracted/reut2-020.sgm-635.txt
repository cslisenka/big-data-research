NO NEED TO STATE U.K. SUPPORT FOR SYSTEM-LAWSON

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said there is more confidence in British financial institutions than in U.S. Equivalents, so there is no need for an official statement that the Bank of England will provide liquidity to the U.K. Financial system.     "Our institutions are in a stronger position, I think, and the state of confidence is very much higher in this country so I see no need for the Bank of England...To make any statement of that kind," he said in an interview on Channel Four television.     Earlier a pledge to provide such liquidity from U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan reassured world markets.     Lawson said the Bank of England also saw no reason to provide such reassurance.     The Bank of England had earlier declined comment.     Analysts said Greenspan's pledge that the Fed would stand behind the U.S. Financial system reassured markets that the current turmoil should not spill over into the rest of the economy through a crisis in a financial institution caught out by heavy equity price losses and bond price volatility.
