TURKISH PREMIER HINTS AT AEGEAN TALKS

Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said Turkey's latest row with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea showed the need for talks and "an opportunity has emerged for this."     He spoke to reporters after talks with Turkey's ambassador to Athens who arrived last night from a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. A reply would be made to Greece shortly, Ozal said.     He did not say whether he was taking up Papandreou's renewed offer to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague but said such a move was not the only way to a solution  Reuter &#3;
