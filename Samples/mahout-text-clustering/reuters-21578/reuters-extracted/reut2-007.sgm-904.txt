CREDIT LYONNAIS SIGNS USSR JOINT VENTURE PACT

French bank Credit Lyonnais said it signed a protocol of agreement with the Soviet Union to establish a joint financial group to help set up and finance joint ventures between the Soviet Union and western firms.     It said in a statement it signed the agreement here with the Soviet central bank (Gosbank) and foreign trade bank (Vneshtorgbank), following the announcement earlier today of a similar, but wholly separate, agreement between the Soviet Union and Banque de l'Union Europeenne.     No joint ventures have yet been finalised under January 1987 Soviet laws enabling joint ventures although some protocols of intent aiming at their establishment have already been agreed between western firms and the Soviet Union.
