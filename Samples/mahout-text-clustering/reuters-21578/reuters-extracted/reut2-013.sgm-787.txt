PORK BELLY FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO HIGHER

Pork belly futures were expected to open steady to higher after yesterday's late strength and sharply higher close in the nearby.     Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by steady to mostly higher live hog calls and light hog runs. Slaughter is likely to remain on the light side and lend support to cash product, they said.     Private reports of hedger interest for cash product also prompted calls of steady to higher for cash bellies this morning, they added.     Guesses on today's out of town storage report ranged from in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs.  Reuter &#3;
