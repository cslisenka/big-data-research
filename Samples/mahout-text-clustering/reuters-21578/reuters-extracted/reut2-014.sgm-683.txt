CONRAIL FILES PETITION AGAINST ERIE <ERIE>

Erie Lackawanna Inc said Consolidated Rail Corp filed with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of a Court of Appeals opinion which held Erie as not being liable for damages allegedly resulting from operations prior to its emergence from reorganization in 1982.     The claims are for damages for asbestosis and other work-related injuries claimed by former employees of the Erie Lackawanna.     Erie said it intends to oppose Conrail's request.  Reuter &#3;
