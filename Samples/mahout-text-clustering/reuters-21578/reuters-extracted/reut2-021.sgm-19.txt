EGYPT TO BUILD HOUSING ESTATES AND ROADS FOR UGANDA

Egypt has agreed to build two housing estates and two new roads in Uganda worth a total of 295 million dollars, Egyptian commercial attache Muhammud el Tahan said.     He said Egyptian companies will build 8,000 housing units in Kampala and reconstruct the roads between Fort Portal and Bundibugyo near the Zaire border in western Uganda and between Kapchorwa and Swam near Mount Elgon in the east of the country. Uganda would repay 70 per cent of the Egyptian Government credit to finance the projects in the form of barter goods and 30 per cent in hard currency, Tahan said.  Reuter &#3;
