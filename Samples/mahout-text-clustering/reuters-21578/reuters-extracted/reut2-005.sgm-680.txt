AMERICAN LOCKER <ALGI> CONDUCTS TESTS

American Locker Group Inc said environmental tests revealed low but unacceptable levels of two chemical compounds in ground water at its Signore plant near here.     The tests, conducted by Dames and Moore, an environmental engineering firm, followed the termination of talks for sale of the plant, which makes steel office furniture.     The company said the compounds were not used as part of its current operations. Testing will continue, it said.  Reuter &#3;
