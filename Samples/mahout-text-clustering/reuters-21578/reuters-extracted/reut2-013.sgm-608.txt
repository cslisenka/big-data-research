VW CURRENCY DEPARTMENT FORMER HEAD ARRESTED

The former chief of foreign exchange at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> has been arrested in connection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker a quarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer said.     He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrested yesterday for suspected embezzlement.     "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evaded justice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for his arrest," Retemeyer said.     VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of the suspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gave him leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.     VW said last month computer programs were erased and documents faked in the possible fraud, in which it believes transactions meant to protect it against foreign currency losses were not completed.     Retemeyer said "We are still investigating a larger circle of people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"     He would not comment whether other arrests could be expected.     The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-up with the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board member in charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility for the affair.     Retemeyer said last month he wanted to question Frankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be able to give more details.  REUTER &#3;
