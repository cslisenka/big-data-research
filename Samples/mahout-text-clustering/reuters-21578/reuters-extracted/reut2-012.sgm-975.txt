CUSTOMS LEVIES BOND ON JAPANESE SHIPMENTS

The Customs Bureau has begun to levy on bond on certain Japanese goods pending a final decision by President Reagan on April 17 on imposing the planned 100 pct tariff on the shipments, the bureau said.     A bureau official said bonding began on March 31 and if the penalties are imposed as expected after a period of comment, they will retroactive to that date.     The penalties are to be levied on variety of electronic items in retaliation for Japan's failure to comply with a July 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in third nations and to open its home market to U.S. goods.  reuter &#3;
