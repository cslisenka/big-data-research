ROYAL PALM <RPAL> SAYS RESTRICTIONS LIFTED

Royal Palm Savings Association said it has entered into an agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Florida Department of Banking and Finance resulting in the removal of limitations which had severely restricted its growth and lending.     The company said it will now be permitted to grow about 70 mln dlrs in calendar 1987, or about 15 pct for this year, and at the same rate thereafter.     Royal Palm said under the accord, it will resume commercial and nonresidential lending but will place substantial emphasis on residential loans.     The company said it agreed to adopt new policies and procedures but did not elaborate.  Reuter &#3;
