PIRELLI SEES RISE IN 1987 GROUP PROFITS, SALES

Net profit and sales for the Pirelli group's worldwide activities should both grow well in 1987, said Jacopo Vittorelli, chief executive of Societe Internationale Pirelli SA <PIRI.Z>.     Sales rose 17.5 pct to 2.75 billion dlrs in the first half of 1987, and Vittorelli told reporters they were likely to show the same percentage growth for the year as a whole.     However, he declined to predict the likely growth in net profit for the year. It rose by 31.7 pct to 80.6 mln dlrs in the first six months. In 1986 group net profit was 141.0 mln dlrs, up from 101.5 mln the year before.  Reuter &#3;
