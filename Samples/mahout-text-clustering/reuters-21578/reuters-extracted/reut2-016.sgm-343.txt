DSC COMMUNICATIONS <DISI.O> AMENDS SUPPLY PACT

DSC Communications Corp said it amended an existing long term supply contract with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> for deliveries of a new tandem switch.     Deliveries of the switch, the DEX 600E, are scheduled to begin in third quarter of 1988 and end by year-end 1989, the telecommunications systems company said.     The new switch increases the port capacity of DSC's existing 600 switches, it said.     Under the amended agreement, DSC will also deliver signal point transfer products to MCI.  Reuter &#3;
