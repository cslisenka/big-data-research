NEW BANGLADESH LAW ALLOWS STATE FIRM SHARE SALES

Parliament passed a law allowing state-owned industrial companies to sell 49 pct of their shares to staff and private investors, the official BSS news agency said.     Under the new law, passed yesterday, 51 pct of shares in the affected companies will be held by the government, 34 pct by the public and 15 pct by staff. The law also allows workers to nominate a member to the board of directors if they buy at least 12 pct of a company's shares.     Bangladesh has returned more than 500 industrial companies to private ownership since March 1982.  REUTER &#3;
