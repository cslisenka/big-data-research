WESTINGHOUSE <WX> TAKES OVER NUCLEAR PLANT

Westinghouse Electric Corp took over operations of several facilities at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash, the DOE said.     It said that Westinghouse replaces Rockwell International and UNC Nuclear Inc, who have been criticized by the state of Washington, the federal government and environmentalists for failing to correct safety problems at Hanford.     Westinghouse signed a four billion dlr contract three weeks ago to operate Hanford for the next five years, DOE said.     The contract provides the company and annual profit between 1.4 mln and 14.6 mln dlrs, depending on the quality of its performance, the DOE said. "Our first objective is to be safe," soid William Jacobi, Westinghouse general manager at Hanford, adding, "If we can make that (safety) a priority we can have the production we need."     Westinghouse's chief mission at Hanford is to produce plutonium, supervise research for the Strategic Defense Inititive, SDI, and the cleanup of military nuclear waste stored in tanks at the site since the 1940's, company and DOE officials said.
