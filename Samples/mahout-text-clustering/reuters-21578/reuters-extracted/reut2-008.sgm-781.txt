FIREMAN'S FUND <FSC> SUBPOENAED BY SEC

Fireman's Fund Corp said it has been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the previously announced investigation into the secondary public offering of its stock by American Express Co on May 9, 1986.     Fireman's Fund said it is cooperating with the SEC.     Last week, American Express Co, its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc unit, and Salomon Inc's Salomon Brothers unit were subpoenaed for records pertaining to a secondary offering of Fireman's Fund stock.     Fireman's Fund had been a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express and now is less than 30 pct owned by the finanancial services giant.     Shearson, lead manager of the underwriting, and Salomon, co-manger, were also subpoenaed for documents pertaining to Jefferies and Co.     Last week, Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies and Co, settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged he violated securities laws, including market manipulation.     The transaction described in SEC documents pertaining to  market manipulation charges mentioned a secondary offering of the stock of a company, which was held by another company.     The documents alleged Jefferies, at the request of a second person, took actions to drive the stock price up before the offering.     The losses to the Jefferies firm were allegedly covered, at the request of the second person, by sending a fake invoice to a third person.     An American Express spokesman said James Robinson, American Express chairman, has said the firm knows of no wrong doing by anyone at the firm.     American Express retained two law firms to carry out an internal investigation.     American Express, Shearson and Salomon all said they would cooperate with the investigation.  Reuter &#3;
