FRANCE APPROVES LARGE DEFENCE SPENDING INCREASE

The French parliament has approved a substantial increase in defence spending to modernise the country's nuclear and conventional forces.     The bill provides 474 billion francs for defence expenditure over a five-year period starting next year, with 32 pct allocated to modernise the country's nuclear weapons systems.     The budget represents a six pct annual increase, starting next year, well above the 3.5 pct NATO recommends for members of its military command. France is a member of NATO but does not belong to its integrated military command.     The budget will help finance three new types of nuclear weapons, a military reconnaissance satellite, a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the AMX Leclerc tank and the possible development of chemical weapons.     The program also includes funds for design work on nuclear missile submarines and the M-5 submarine-launched missile.  REUTER &#3;
