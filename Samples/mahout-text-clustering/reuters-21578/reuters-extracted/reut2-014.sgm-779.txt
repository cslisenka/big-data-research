U.S. DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN HONG KONG

The U.S. Dollar opened slightly lower in moderately active trading as bearish sentiment persisted, dealers said.     They said the selling pressure was light ahead of expected meetings of leading finance ministers in Washington this week. Participants tended to keep their positions small and Bank of Japan intervention shortly after Tokyo's opening at around 145.30 yen failed to have a strong impact on the market, they said.     The dollar opened at 1.8247/57 marks against New York's 1.8270/80 close and the 1.8205/15 finish here yesterday.     The dollar opened at 145.40/50 yen but weakened to near 145.30 when the Bank of Japan intervened. It finished at 145.60/70 in New York and 145.15/20 here yesterday.     Dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortably above the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt to break that level failed for lack of momentum. But the markets generally are not expecting much from the Washington talks today, they added.     The dollar is expected to stay within a tight range today with considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270 mark levels, dealers said.     Dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions.     Volcker told a Congressional committee the dollar's fall so far should be "large enough ... To support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     Miyazawa, after meeting Treasury Secretary James Baker, said they agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the U.S. Has played in supporting the dollar since the February Paris accord.     Sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against New York's 1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.     Dealers said sterling sentiment remains positive as the ruling Conservative party maintained its lead in opinion polls. But they said technical selling may depress it to 1.6150.     The Hong Kong dollar opened at 7.8005/25 against its U.S. Counterpart compared with yesterday's 7.8015/35 close.     Local interest rates tended easier with overnight opening at four 3-1/2 pct against yesterday's 4-1/2 four pct close.     Asian dollar rates were steady with three months opening unchanged at 6-1/2 3/8 pct.     The dollar started at 1.5147/57 Swiss francs against New York's 1.5145/55 close and the 1.5137/47 finish here yesterday, and at 6.0690/0720 French francs against 6.0780/0810 and 6.0600/20.
