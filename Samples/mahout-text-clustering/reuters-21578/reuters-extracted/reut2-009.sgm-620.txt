LITTLE SUPPORT FOR MANDATORY ACREAGE CUTS - LYNG

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he believes proposed legislation calling for mandatory acreage reductions has little support in Congress and voiced Reagan administration opposition to it.     "The administration would be very much opposed to that legislation," he told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch.     "But fortunately I don't detect a strong interest in that legislation." He added, "I doubt there will be (enough) support to get it out."     The controversial bill, supported by Representative Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, calls for a national referendum to be conducted that could result in mandatory unpaid acreage cuts of up to 35 pct, paid land diversion beyond that level if necessary and a marketing quota.
