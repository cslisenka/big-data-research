QUANTECH <QANT.O> GETS NASDAQ EXCEPTION

Quantech Electronics Corp said its common stock will continue to be quoted on the NASDAQ system due to an exception from National Association of Securities Dealers capital and surplus requirements, which it failed to meet as of August 31.     The company said it believes it can meet conditions imposed by the NASD for the exception, but there can be no assurance that it will do so.  Reuter &#3;
