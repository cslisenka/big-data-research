KEMP PRAISES GREENSPAN VIEWS ON MONETARY REFORM

Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative Republican from New York, praised Federal Reserve Board chairman-designate Alan Greenspan's calls for international monetary reform.     "Alan Greenspan has called for a fundamental reform of the international monetary system, which is long overdue. The challenge facing Mr Greenspan is to combine a commitment to monetary reform with a policy for economic growth," Kemp said in a statement.
