FEEDER CATTLE FUTURES SET NEW HIGHS, TURN MIXED

Feeder Cattle futures advanced 0.20 to 0.30 cent at the start and posted new season's highs in April through August and October before slipping to trade 0.10 cent lower to 0.20 higher in latest trade.     Futures ran up to new highs at the start on general demand prompted by continued strong cattle fundamentals. Posting of another 10 cent gain in the latest reported average feeder steer price added to support, traders said.     However, prices retreated on profit-taking following the lead of other meat pits. Stotler notably sold April on the decline, they said.  Reuter &#3;
