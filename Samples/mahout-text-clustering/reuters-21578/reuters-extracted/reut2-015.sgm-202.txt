CUBA TO STIMULATE ECONOMY DESPITE IMPORT CUTS

Cuba will continue to develop its economy despite the need to cut imports from hard currency nations by half this year, President Fidel Castro said.     The Cuban economy is going through a difficult period due mainly to two years of drought, low sugar prices, a fall in the price of petroleum and the fall in the value of the dollar, Castro said in a published weekend speech delivered to a young communists union congress.     Castro said  cuba will continue to prospect for oil, build thermo-electric generating stations, a large petroleum refinery and a nuclear power plant in 1987.     He said work would also continue this year in developing the chemical and mining industries. Among the main projects in mining are two nickel processing plants built with Soviet and Comecon aid .
