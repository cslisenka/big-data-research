HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE, LILLY <LLY> IN LICENSE PACT

Hoffmann-La Roche Inc, the licensee of a Hormone Research Foundation patent of a synthetic version of human growth hormone, said it entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Co involving Lilly's Humatrope hormone used to treat dwarfism in children.     Details of the license agreement were not disclosed and company officials were unavailable for comment.     A statement from the companies said, "Lilly and Roche have entered into the license agreement as an alternative to litigation."     South San Francisco-based Genetech Inc <GENE> also markets a genetically engineered human growth hormone called Protropin. Lilly received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market is human growth hormone earlier this year.     A Lilly spokesperson said the company has in effect licensed the patent for the hormone through Hoffman-LaRoche. She refused to comment on the terms of the license agreement.     Last September, Hoffman-LaRoche and the Foundation sued Genetech in a Federal court in California alleging its product infringed on Hoffman's patent for the synthetic hormone.  Reuter &#3;
