EXXON <XON> TO LIMIT DIRECTORS' LIABILITY

Exxon Corp said that it will move to protect its directors from liabilities arising from lawsuits charging gross negligence.     Exxon said directors' liabilities will be limited and they will be indemnified for actions taken in pursuit of duties.     The company said it was taking the opportunity to change its bylaws and incoroporation certificate following changes in the law of New Jersey, where the company is incoporated.     The measures are being submitted to shareholders and will be voted on at Exxon's annual meeting to be held May 21 in New Orleans the company said in proxy material sent to shareholders.     Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the company's certificate to eliminate directors' maximum personal monetary liability to the limit New Jersey allows.     New Jersey recently permitted corporations to eliminate monetary liability directors and owners may incur for breach of duty care owed by them to corporations and shareholders.     The company said that the principal effect of the measure "will be to eliminate potential monetary damage actions against directors."     But the amendment will only limit liability in the event of unintentional errors.     It does not limit their liability for actions taken in knowing violation of the law, nor will it limit potential liabilities from violations of federal securities laws, the company said in its proxy statemernt.     A second measure proposed to shareholders is an amendment to bylaws already voted on by the directors at their January Board meeting making indeminifiacation of directors mandatory.     Exxon said that it had currently purchased such insurance from a captive insurance copany in the amount of 50 mln dlrs in excess of 50 mln dlrs issued by independent companies to Exxon to indemnify its directors.
