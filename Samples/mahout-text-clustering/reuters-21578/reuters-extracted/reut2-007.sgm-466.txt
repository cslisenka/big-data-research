HOUSE GOP BUDGET WRITERS WITHHOLD VOTES

Republican members of the House Budget Committee refused to cast their votes as the committee began marking up the outlines of next year's federal budget.     Republicans voted "present" during votes on a ceiling for fiscal 1988 defense spending, saying they were protesting the Democrats' failure to present an alternative to President Reagan's budget, which was completed in January.     Without the Republicans' votes, the Democratic majority on the committee voted tentatively 13-8 to cap 1988 defense spending at 282.6 billion dlrs, three billion dlrs more than current year defense outlays.     Rep. William Gray (D-Pa.), the Budget Committee chairman, decided earlier this week to use current government spending levels as a starting point for the panel's deliberations.     In the past, the committee Democrats had always gone behind closed doors to agree in advance on a draft budget plan.     But this year, the Democrats could not come to an agreement, prompting Gray to invite the Republicans to join them in the drafting process in open session.     Republicans argued that this maneuver enabled the Democrats to avoid presenting alternatives to the president's budget.  Reuter &#3;
