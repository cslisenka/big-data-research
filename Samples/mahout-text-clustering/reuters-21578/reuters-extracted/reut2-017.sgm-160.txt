U.S. ENERGY COSTS ROSE IN MARCH BY 1.0 PCT

Consumer energy costs rose 1.0 pct in March following a moderate rise last month, the Labor Department said.     The March increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 3.0 pct rise in January and a 1.9 pct rise in February, it said.     However, energy prices were 5.6 pct below year-ago levels.     The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in March by 2.3 pct, after a 4.2 pct rise in February.     Gasoline prices were nonetheless 5.9 pct below their levels as of March 1986.     Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in March by 1.4 pct, putting it 9.0 pct under the year-ago figure.     The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.1 pct from the March 1986 figure, the department said.     The index has been updated to reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns. Previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.  Reuter &#3;
