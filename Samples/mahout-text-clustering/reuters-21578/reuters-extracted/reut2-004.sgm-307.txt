AMERICAN CENTURY CORP <ACT> GETS INJUNCTION

American Century Corp said it was granted an injunction against Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates barring them from taking or selling any of the collateral for a 12 mln dlr line of credit extended by Merrill.     American said State District Judge Fred Biery granted the injunction in connection with a suit filed by <G.H.Stool> against Merrill Lynch in November 1986.     Under the order, Merrill Lynch is barred from taking or selling the collateral, namely 32 pct of the outstanding American Century shares plus real estate interests, for the credit line extended to <G.H. Stool>, American's chairman John Kerr and Robert Feldman, a director with American.     The company said the suit seeks punitive and actual damanges from Merrill Lynch for fraud and refusing to honor what it contends was a binding commitment to a extend and increase the loan to provide the financing to acquire 100 pct of the American Century shares.
