FIRESTONE <FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS

Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire plants on or before September 15.     A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986.     The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants.      Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months.     Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants, it added.     Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers.     Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits and work rules.     Union procedures, however, require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.     The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants.
