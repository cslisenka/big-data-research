U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER SEES ACTION ON FSLIC FUNDING

House Speaker Jim Wright said he expects the House Banking Committee to approve legislation in "a week or so" for an infusion of funding for the cash-short Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).     The agency, which insures depositors in thrift institutions against losses, only has about 1.9 billion dlrs left, House Banking Committee officials said.     The administration wants legislation for a long term 15 billion dlr replenishment, but Wright is pushing for an emergency, short-term five billion funding effort.     Wright made his prediction in a talk with reporters.  Reuter &#3;
