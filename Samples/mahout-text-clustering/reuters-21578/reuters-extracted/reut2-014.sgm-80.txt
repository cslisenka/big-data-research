SPOT TIN SLIGHTLY LOWER ON EUROPEAN FREE MARKET

Spot tin on the European free market was indicated in the range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam, down 10 stg from yesterday afternoon.     Traders said the market remained quiet with sales reported between 4,230 and 4,210 stg and currency factors still tending to weigh on the price structure.     There was still no sign of significant fresh end-user enquiry for second-quarter requirements, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;
