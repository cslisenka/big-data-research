(PIPER AIRCRAFT) RESUMES OUTPUT OF SOME MODELS

Privately-held Piper Aircraft Corp said it has decided to resume production of some Piper models that had faced suspension as soon as existing orders were filled.     The company said the decision to resume production reflected improved demand for Piper products mainly due to currency factors and reduced inventories.     It said it will immediately resume production of the PA-28-161 Warrior, PA-28-181 Archer, PA-28R Arrow, PA-28-236 Dakota, PA-32 and PA-32R Saratoga and Pa-34 Seneca in numbers depending on market demand.         The company said it will continue to make the PA-46 Mailbu and resume production of the Cheyenne IIIA and Pa-42-400 Cheyenne late this year.  Reuter &#3;
