U.S. SENATE GROUP EYES 37 BLN DLR DEFICIT CUT

billion-dlr package of budget deficit reductions, half through unspecificed new revenues, to cut the 1988 deficit with a goal of balancing the budget in 1991 under a new law's target.     The committee went over a package of deficit reductions proposed by its chairman, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida, which he said would reach the 108-billion-dlr deficit in 1988 under the Gramm-Rudman budget law -- using President Reagan's economic estimates.     Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates, which Congress usually relies on, would produce a deficit of 134 billion dlrs, Chiles said.     Under the Chiles plan, deficits would be cut from anticipated levels by nearly 110 billion dlrs over four years to produce a 1991 balanced budget--the target of the Gramm Rudman law.     For 1988, the Chiles formula would cut the deficit by 37 billion dlrs, half through defence and non defence savings,m the rest through revenues.     Defence would be cut nearly 6.9 billion dlrs. Reagan proposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.     His non defence budget savings, including health, welfare, agricultural, government services and reduced interest payments, amount to 11.6 billion dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
