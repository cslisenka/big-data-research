PHILIPS SEES HIGHER FIRST QUARTER TURNOVER

NV Philips Gloielampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> expects volume turnover to show "a satisfactory increase" in the first 1987 quarter, chairman Cor van der Klugt told the annual shareholders meeting.     But an average dollar rate of only 2.07 guilders against the 2.69 guilders in the first quarter of 1986 would take turnover for January to March this year in guilder terms to less than the 13.06 billion guilders posted in the comparable 1986 period.     He said all the first quarter figures were not yet available and would be released on April 29.  Reuter &#3;
