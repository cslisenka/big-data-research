REAGAN DID NOT RECALL APPROVING ARMS DEAL, COUNSEL

President Reagan's legal adviser said the President could not recall when he approved a 1985 arms sale to Iran, the New York Times reported.     "We were trying to stimulate his (Reagan's) recollection and he had no recollection, although he remembered being surprised about something," Peter Wallison, who is resigning, was quoted as saying in an interview.     "That led us to expect that he would not be able to recall (the date) when he appeared before the Tower board," Wallison said, referring to the question of whether Reagan gave prior approval to an Israeli shipment of U.S. Arms to Iran.     Wallison said John Poindexter, then head of the National Security Council (NSC), kept him from probing the scandal for weeks after it was first made public last November, the Times reported.     Wallison told the newspaper that Poindexter, who resigned from his NSC post last November 25, refused to give him information about the deal, despite pleas by former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan.     "Regan told me on several occasions that he had been unable to move Poindexter to include me in any of the discussions or to provide me with ... The facts," he said.  REUTER &#3;
