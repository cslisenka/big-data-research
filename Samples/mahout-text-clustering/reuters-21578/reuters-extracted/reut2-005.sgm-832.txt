CARGILL STRIKE TALKS CONTINUING TODAY

Further talks will be held this morning at Cargill U.K. Ltd's oilseed processing plant at Seaforth, after yesterday's meeting between management and unions failed to produce a solution to end the three month old strike, a company spokesman said.     Talks will be extended to tomorrow if there is no breakthrough in today's session, he said.  REUTER &#3;
