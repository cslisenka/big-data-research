HARCOURT <HBJ> HAS NO COMMENT ON SUIT

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc said it has no comment at this time on the lawsuit filed against it by British publisher Robert Maxwell.     In the suit, Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp is attempting to stop Harcourt's payment of a 40 dlr per share special dividend and other actions.     Harcourt announced its recapitalization plan to escape a hostile bid by Maxwell. Maxwell last week withdrew his 44 dlr per share or two billion dlr bid because of the plan.  Reuter &#3;
