ASIAN SMALL MARKETS REEL FROM WALL STREET

Stock markets in Asia's economic "little dragons," seen as hot tips for global investors, reeled today as share prices crashed in the U.S., The region's main trading partner.     Panic spread through Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea following the collapse on Wall Street.     Officials in Hong Kong, worried that the notoriously volatile market would go wild, suspended trading until next Monday. Markets in Taiwan and South Korea, sheltered from swings on the world's big bourses, were battered this time.     Taipei's weighted index fell almost by its full permitted level, shedding 172.9 points to close at 3,492.9.     Seoul's composite index lost over 11 points by late morning to 505.28, with investors worried about a possible rise in oil prices after U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf.     "When the U.S. Catches cold, Taiwan sneezes," said general manager Blair Pickerell of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Limited. "In this case, Taiwan has got pneumonia."     Blue chips in Singapore were hit by selling. The Straits Times Industrial Index lost 190.12 points in late afternoon trading to 1,033.16, breaking Monday's fall of 169.14 points.  Reuter &#3;
