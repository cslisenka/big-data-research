SEARS <S> SETTLED TO AVOID FURTHER LEGAL COSTS

Sears Roebuck and Co, said it reached an out-of-court settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over the labeling of some down-filled garments sold in 1978 "to avoid further legal expenses."     In a statement, Michael Bozic, chairman of Sears Merchandise Group, said "As part of the voluntary corrective program, Sears removed 75 mln dlrs worth of down-filled merchandise from sale prior to the FTC investigation, retested and where necessary, relabeled goods and nationally offered a full refund."     Sears said it was "the only retailer to take extensive steps to protect consumers, despite the fact that down-labeling discrepancies were industry-wide in 1978."     Both Sears and Kellwood Co, a Sears supplier, agreed to pay penalties of 200,000 dlrs each to settle the charges.  Reuter &#3;
