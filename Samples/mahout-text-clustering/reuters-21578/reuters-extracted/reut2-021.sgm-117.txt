INVESTOR SUES FIRST NORTHERN SAVINGS <FNGB.O>

Investor Donald Knutson said he filed a suit against First Northern Savings and Loan Association of Green Bay, stating his request of management for access to First Northern's stockholder lists had been denied.      Knutson owns about 9.9 pct of First Northern's outstanding stock. He said in his complaint he intends to use the list to cause a special meeting of First Northern's shareholders to be convened to discuss his concerns over the lack of liquidity in the trading market for the stock of First Northern and methods of increasing the value of the shares.
