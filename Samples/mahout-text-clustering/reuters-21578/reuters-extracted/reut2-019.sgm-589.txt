KUWAIT SETS HIGHER 1987/88 BUDGET DEFICIT

Kuwait, aided by the recovery in world oil prices, announced a mildly expansionary budget for 1987/88 with a 3.3 pct rise in the deficit to 1.38 billion dinars.     Oil revenues, slashed by some 40 pct in the original budget for the 1986/87 year ending tomorrow, were forecast to rise 4.2 pct to 1.73 billion dinars in 1987/88, Finance Minister Jassim al-Khorafi said.     This would account for 87.2 pct of total estimated income in the year starting on July 1 compared with 86.6 pct in original 1986/87 estimates, the Kuwait News Agency Kuna quoted him as saying.     Spending by ministries and public institutions is forecast to be 3.4 pct higher at 3.16 billion dinars in 1987/88 after an 11 pct cut in the current fiscal year's budget.     In addition the government, as is usual, will transfer a sum equal to 10 pct of total expected revenue to a special savings reserve for future generations.     The minister made no mention of how the deficit would be covered. He also gave no actual outturn for spending and income in 1986/87.  REUTER &#3;
