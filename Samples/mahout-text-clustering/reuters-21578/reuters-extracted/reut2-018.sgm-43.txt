JAPANESE FARMERS PROTEST OPENING MARKETS

Thousands of farmers gathered in central Tokyo to urge the government to stand firm against foreign pressure for further opening up of Japan's markets to foreign agricultural products, union officials said.     Officials of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives said about 5,000 representatives from 4,200 farming groups joined the demonstration.     The organisers said the farmers demanded that the government should avoid easy compromises on liberalising agricultural imports at next week's economic summit in Venice.     The United States and the European Community want Japan to remove tariffs and quotas to help cut their trade deficits with Japan.     Under a banner reading "The government and parliament must not sacrifice farmers," the demonstrators adopted a declaration saying they would fight any unreasonable moves to open Japanese markets to foreign agricultural products.     An agriculture ministry official said Japan and the United States were expected to hold talks on Japanese import ceilings for U.S. Beef and citrus fruit in September.  Reuter &#3;
