NY COTTON EXTENDS GAINS LATE, SETTLES HIGHER

Cotton futures extended their gains in late dealings when trade selling dissipated, allowing local and speculative buying to increase, brokers said.     The market settled 0.75 to 0.50 cent stronger, with spot May ended 0.70 better at 56.50 cents a lb.     May got as high as 56.75 cents but profit-taking by early buyers trimmed gains, brokers said.     Early demand came from traders convinced that the market was technically oversold, brokers said.     Trade buying bolstered new-crop contracts, brokers said. December settled 0.72 cent firmer at 55.47 cents.  Reuter &#3;
