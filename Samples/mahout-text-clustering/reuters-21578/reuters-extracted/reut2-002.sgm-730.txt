GATT STUDYING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES CEILING

The world trade body GATT said its negotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a ceiling on agricultural subsidies.     GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the table.     He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with high subsidy spending.     Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from 1979-81.     Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24 billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.     Yves Berthelot, an official for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said the suppression of agricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which would allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic prices, would be difficult but inevitable.
