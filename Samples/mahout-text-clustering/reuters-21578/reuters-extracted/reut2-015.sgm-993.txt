LTV <QLTV> TO MAKE ONE-TIME BENEFIT PAYMENTS

LTV Corp said it will seek approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court to make one-time hardship payments to retired steelworkers who lost some pension benefits when their retirement plans were terminated.     The payments would range from 100 dlrs to 750 dlrs per person for more than 9,800 steel company salaried and hourly retirees, LTV said.     The company's steel unit retirement plans were terminated in January by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which said the plans were insolvent.     LTV filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July 17.     Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it works out a plan to pay debts.     While most regular pension payments were continued after LTV Steel Co's pension plans were terminated, some retirees got a reduction in their supplemental early retirement benefits or other payments that were more than maximums guaranteed by the federal agency.     LTV also began talks with the United Steelworkers union, and both sides have made a commitment to reach a new labor agreement by May 1, the steel, aerospace and energy concern said.     LTV has the right to renegotiate its labor contracts while operating in Chapter 11. At issue are pension and health benefits for active and retired employees and other items, such as use of manpower and equipment.     The company plans to present a comprehensive proposal to the U.S. bankruptcy court in May to deal with pensions and health care benefits for steel and energy retirees and health care benefits for aerospace retirees, it said.     All LTV retirees are currently receiving health and life insurance payments mandated by federal laws passed in October that have been extended until May 15.  Reuter &#3;
