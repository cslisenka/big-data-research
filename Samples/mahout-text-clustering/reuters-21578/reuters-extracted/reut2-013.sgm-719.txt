LME NICKEL MIDSESSION BOOSTED BY TRADE BUYING

LME nickel ended the morning with three months business at 2,365 stg per tonne, up about seven stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1.7225 dlrs per lb, a rise of 0.5 cents.     The market traded up to 2,370 stg near the official morning ring close under the influence of trade buying before speculative selling halted the advance, traders said.     Borrowing interest over the last two delivery months was seen at a narrower contango of five stg.     The market now appears to be showing signs of mild dollar-based bullishness, analysts said.
