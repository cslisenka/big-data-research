UGANDAN GOODWILL MISSION TO VISIT KENYA

A Ugandan goodwill mission led by minister of state in the presidency Balaki Kirya will visit Kenya tomorrow for talks on improving strained relations between the two countries, diplomatic sources said.     If the talks go well, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is likely to have a meeting with Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi when he pays a two-day visit to Nairobi to attend U.N ceremonies on Friday and Saturday, they added.     Relations between the two states showed the first signs of recovery yesterday after three months of steady deterioration.     The Kenyan President told a military parade there was no border tension with Uganda and the Kenyan border was fully open for cargo movements.  Reuter &#3;
