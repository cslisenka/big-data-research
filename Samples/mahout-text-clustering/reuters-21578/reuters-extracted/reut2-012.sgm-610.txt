UTILICORP <UCU> DIVISION CUTS GAS RATES

Utilicorp United said the Iowa Utilities Board has ordered its Peoples Natural Gas division to reduce its rates to customers by 313,937 dlrs.     Utilicorp said it will request a reconsideration of the order within 20 days and the Board will have 20 days to act upon the request.     The company said the reduction was the result of a rate request filed by Peoples in May 1986 for an 8.6 mln dlr increase. The Board granted Peoples an interim increase of 4.2 mln dlrs in August 1986, Utilicorp said.  Reuter &#3;
