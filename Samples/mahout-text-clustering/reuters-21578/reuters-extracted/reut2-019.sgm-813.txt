JAGUAR PLANS ONE BILLION STG OUTLAY

Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> will spend about one billion stg over the next six years on expanded production, automation and improved efficiency, Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan said.     He told reporters the company planned to raise production to around 80,000 cars a year by 1992 from 47,000 this year, while productivity was expected to rise to 5.5 cars per worker in 1990 compared with four cars now.     Egan said the XJ6 model introduced last October was the first of a new saloon car family. Jaguar planned to bring out a new sports car in the early 1990s, probably called the "F."  Reuter &#3;
