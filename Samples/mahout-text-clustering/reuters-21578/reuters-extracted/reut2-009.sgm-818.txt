SIEMENS U.S. TURNOVER TO RISE IN CURRENT YEAR

Siemens AG <SIEG.F> turnover in the United States will rise to about 2.6 billion dlrs in the current year to end September from 2.2 billion in 1985/86, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.     He told the annual meeting 80 pct of last year's sales came from products made in the U.S.. He added Siemens was as interested as U.S. Authorities in reducing the massive trade deficit and calming down trade relations.     "But we would show no understanding if this (trade deficit reduction) was attempted through means incompatible with the principle of free world trade," Kaske said.     Siemens has been the subject of pressure by U.S. Telecommunications authorities to limit its access to the U.S. Market for digital telephone switching equipment.     The Federal Communications Commission announced in December it was starting an enquiry into the blocking of free access to the telecommunications market by foreign firms, with officers saying reciprocal access was not available to U.S. Firms abroad.     For years Siemens was the only supplier of public switching stations to the Bundespost, the German federal post office. Regulatory authorities in 1982 opened Bundespost contracts to tenders from other domestic and foreign suppliers.     But foreign authorities have complained that too many restrictions to overseas suppliers still remain.     Kaske said neither Siemens nor the Bundespost could be held responsible for the U.S. Trade deficit and noted the U.S. Was still achieving substantial surpluses in trade with West Germany in the electrical and telecommunications sector.     The Bundespost is far more open to supplies from abroad than telephone companies in the U.S. Japan or France, he added.  Reuter &#3;
