JARDINE TO JOIN CONSORTIUM FOR HK SECOND AIRPORT

The Bermuda registered <Jardine Matheson and Co Ltd> has indicated it would participate in a local consortium led by Hopewell Holdings Ltd <HPWH.HK> which has proposed to build the second airport here, a Hopewell statement said.     Jardine Matheson will take up a five pct stake in the joint venture which has presented the government with a 25 billion H.K. Dlr infrastructure development plan for Hong Kong's offshore island of Lantau.     The proposal includes an airport, a deep-water port and highways linking with Southern China.     Hopewell, which initiated the proposal, owns a 20 pct stake in the consortium. Chairman of the firm Gordon Wu said recently he expects the airport to start operation by mid-1992 and the whole project to be completed by 1993 if an approval for the project is obtained within a year.     Other partners of the joint venture comprise a combined 20 pct stake by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HKG> and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HKG>, while Wu said at that time the remaining 60 pct will be taken up by other interested parties -- the public, and probably the Hong Kong and Chinese governments.
