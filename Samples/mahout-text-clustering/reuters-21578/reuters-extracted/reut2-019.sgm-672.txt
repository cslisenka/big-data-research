TEXTRON <TXT> UNIT STRIKE ENDS

Textron Inc unit Bell Helicopter Textron Inc said it and two United Auto Workers union locals agreed to a new three-year contract, ending a three week strike.     It said production and maintenance members of Local 218 had been on strike for three weeks while clerical members of Local 317 had been on strike for a week. A total of 4,000 people were out on strike.     A company spokesman said the strike was based on a disagreement over the method of future pay rises.     The spokesman said the company's original offer was based on lump sum payments over three years at six pct in the first year, four pct in the second year and three pct in the third.     He said management and the unions later agreed to a system that combined general pay increases with lump sum payments over the life of the contract.  Reuter &#3;
