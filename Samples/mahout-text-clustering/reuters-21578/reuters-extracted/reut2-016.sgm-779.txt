ABE SAYS 5,000 BILLION YEN PACKAGE TO SATISFY U.S.

Japan's plan to stimulate its economy will inject about 5,000 billion yen into the economy and should be appreciated by the U.S., Ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) executive council chairman Shintaro Abe told reporters.     "I expect considerable U.S. Appreciation of measures I have personally prepared with cooperation of the government and the LDP to help solve some individual issues pending with the United States," he said.     Abe, former Foreign Minister, starts a week long visit to Washington on Sunday.     Abe said he will meet President Reagan, Vice President George Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, Treasury Secretary James Baker, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and as many Congressmen as possible.     Washington is likely to announce today a series of tariff sanctions against Japanese electrical products after it accused Tokyo of failing to meet terms of a 1986 bilateral pact on computer chip trade.     "I will ask U.S. Leaders to rescind any sanctions," said Abe.     Japanese officials have said Tokyo would appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for possible compensation or the right to retaliate should U.S. Sanctions materialise.     But Abe said, "We should not repeat retaliatory measures. What I would like to say to the United States is retaliation or protectionism alone cannot solve our trade disputes."  REUTER &#3;
