EUROBOND MARKET GENERALLY FIRMER WHERE CHANGED

Secondary sectors of the eurobond market, where changed, were generally firmer in quiet morning trading with attention again tending to focus on currencies other than the dollar, dealers said.     The sterling straight market opened with further gains of 1/8 or 1/4 point with sentiment boosted by the publication of two more opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party with a substantial lead over opposition parties.     Dealers said operators seem a little more cautious this morning since profit-taking is expected to emerge soon after recent substantial gains.     The dollar straight sector was little changed with yesterday's gains on the U.S. Bond market being balanced out by a slightly easier dollar. The market is now awaiting news which may emerge from tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in Washington.     "It's not often you can call the dollar straight sector a backwater in the market but that's what it is at the moment," a head trader at a U.S. Firm said.     U.S. Treasury security trading was also quiet with retail participation limited to enquiry, dealers said. The 30-year long bond was quoted at 95-30/32 pct at 0845 GMT.     The yen and Australian dollar sectors remained buoyant although volume was lower than yesterday morning, dealers said. Yen bonds were 1/4 to 3/8 point firmer with initial buying coming from the Far East, dealers said.     The market was boosted by a very firm Japanese bond market in which the yield on the key 5.1 pct bond due 1996 dropped to close at 3.905 pct compared with yesterday's close of 3.955 pct.     In the Australian dollar market there was some retail demand for zero coupon bonds, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;
