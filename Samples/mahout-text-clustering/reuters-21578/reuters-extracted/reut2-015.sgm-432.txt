THREE BRAZILIAN GOVERNORS SEEK REMOVAL OF FUNARO

Brazil's three most powerful state governors have joined forces to seek the removal of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro.     The governors of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais told a news conference they want changes in the cabinet and in the shaping of economic policy, with Funaro singled out for criticism by Sao Paulo governor Orestes Quercia.     They made their call while Funaro is in Washington holding talks with creditors on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr foreign debt. reuter^M &#3;
