ATT <T> LAUNCHES NEW SOFTWARE PACKAGES

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it is introducing four new software packages for graphic designers and those who produce slides who need advanced but inexpensive software.     ATT said the new products are the first in its line of SoftVisions software and are designed for use with its Truevision videographics boards. It said those boards are adapted to let its PC 6300s series and compatible personal computers display television-quality video images.     Earlier today, ATT introduced a new minicomputer and other computer peripheral products.     Among the new software packages ATT is introducing are RIO, which it said cuts the time and cost involved in producing high-quality 35-millimeter slides with a mix of still video and computer-generated images. It costs 1,250 dlrs.     Another product, ImageMaster, lets PC users reproduce images created with any of ATT's Truevision boards, said ATT. That system also costs 1,250 dlrs.     The two other systems are TARGA CAD Driver, which sells for 225 dlrs, and ImageStation, with a list price of 1,250 dlrs.      Reuter &#3;
