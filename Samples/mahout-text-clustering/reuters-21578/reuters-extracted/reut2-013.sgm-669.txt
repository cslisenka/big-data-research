LME COPPER MIDSESSION FEATURES CASH PRICING

LME morning ring dealings in copper ended with three months Grade A business at 883 stg per tonne, up seven stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1,417 dlrs per tonne, a rise of 11 dlrs.     Morning ring dealings featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32 stg, unchanged from yesterday afternoon, traders said.     Forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency factors, with short covering and some chart support evident.     Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation of 23 stg.     Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a minor chart support base, although upside potential remains limited against a background of routine physical demand and a buoyant U.K. Currency.     On the pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based and within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders said.     Standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg but was tradeless.
