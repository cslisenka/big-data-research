TOKYO GROUP DEVELOPS FASTER AIDS SCREEN

A Tokyo Medical College group said it had developed a five-minute method that may be the world's fastest way of screening people for the AIDS virus.     Lecturer Junko Renard told a meeting of the Japan Blood Transfusion Society new Latex Particle Agglutination Test used a light meter to identify acquired immune deficiency syndrome in blood mixed with a reagent and a latex rubber compound.     State officials said Japan will step up its anti-AIDS campaign with 340,000 posters and a telephone counselling service in 21 cities this month. It will also hand out 90,000 books on AIDS diagnosis to hospitals and clinics.  REUTER &#3;
