WOODSTREAM <WOD> SEES SECOND QUARTER LOSS

Woodstream Corp said it expects a second quarter loss on sales below those of a year earlier.     In last year's second quarter, Woodstream earned 349,000 dlrs on sales of 13.1 mln dlrs.     The company said it is seeking to reduce expenses and boost sales.  It said it is scaling back California fishing rod operations to cut overhead expenses anbd minimize losses.     Woodstream said its fishing technologies group is experieincing significantly higher selling, promotion and factory expenses, while fishing product sales have fallen due to inventory corrections by several major customers.     It said sales of its color liquid display fish/depth finder are expected to exceed three mln dlrs in the first half but will be substantially less than expected.  Reuter &#3;
