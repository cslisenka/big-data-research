WANG <WAN> ANNOUNCES FOUR COMPUTERS

Wang Laboratories Inc announced four additions to its VS line of minicomputers which it said will offer double the capacity of the older models they replace.     Company officials told a news conference that Wang will also announce new entry level and high end computers within the next 12 months and a family of powerful work stations by the end of this year.     Ian Diery, Wang's senior vice president of U.S. operations, said the new models are lower priced than comparable computers from Digital Equipment Corp <DEC>, the world's largest maker of minicomputers.         Minicomputers are medium sized machines usually used within a department or work group of a larger company and typically cost between 10,000 and 500,000 dlrs.     The VS 5E will replace Wang's entry level VS 5. Priced at 13,000 dlrs, it can support up to 16 users, double the eight supported by the five and has three times the disc capacity of the older system.     The VS 6E can support up to 32 users, double the capacity of the model six it replaces, and has three times the storage capacity of the older model. The 6E is priced at 22,000 dlrs.         The VS 75E, which replaces the 65, can support 64 users, 60 pct more than the older model and has twice the main memory capacity. It is priced at 44,000 dlrs.     The new VS 7010, which acts as an entry level system for Wang's more powerful 7000 family of minicomputers, can support between 30 and 55 users. It is priced at 75,000 dlrs.     All the new systems are now available, Diery said.     Bob Ano, Wang's senior vice president of corporate marketing, said that before the end of the company's fiscal year on June 30 it will introduce an entry level computer that will have four times the power of the 5E introduced today.         Within the next 12 to 18 months, he said, Wang will announce a more powerful high-end machine that will offer double the price/performance of its 7000 series.     Ano said the new family of work stations planned for this year will have a 32-bit semiconductor and be able to support the industry standard MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems.  Reuter &#3;
