HECK'S <HEX> CHANGES AUDITORS

Heck's Inc said it has named Touche Ross and Co to replace KMG Main Hurdman as auditor.     A company spokesman said the change was made in connection with Heck's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on March 5.     The company said Touche Ross will complete work on 1986 financial statements that had been begun by KMG Main Hurdman.     Heck's also said Bernard H. Frank has resigned from the board for health reasons but remains the senior officer of its wholesale division.  Reuter &#3;
