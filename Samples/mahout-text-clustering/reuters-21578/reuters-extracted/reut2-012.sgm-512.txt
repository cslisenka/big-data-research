TOSHIBA PRODUCES SUPERCONDUCTIVE WIRE

Officials at Toshiba <TSBA.T> told reporters they have developed a kind of wire which can conduct electricity with no resistance and therefore no loss of power.     Although other firms have developed such superconductive materials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire.     Developing a superconducting material that works at room temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic worldwide scientific race. The main applications would be in super powerful magnets, small computers of immense power and speed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power, and electric generators which consume no power.     Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines.     But problems still have to be surmounted. Present superconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to very low temperatures before they can pass electricity with no resistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants.     Superconductors developed to date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current, only direct current, government scientists said.     Toshiba, which spent 190.3 billion yen on research and development in the year ended March 31 1986, counts itself among the leading superconductor research companies in Japan, manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said..     The wires the company uses are a blend of yttrium, barium and copper oxide and can conduct with no resistance at minus 179.5 degrees centigrade.  REUTER &#3;
