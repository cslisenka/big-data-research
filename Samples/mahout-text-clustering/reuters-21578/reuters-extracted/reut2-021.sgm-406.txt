SUN MICRO'S <SUNW.O> TOPS UPGRADES SOFTWARE

Sun Microsystems Co's TOPS subsidiary said it will have upgraded versions of its NetPrint and LAN -- local area network -- software packages available early next month.     The company said version 2.0 of its NetPrint will be available November 10 at a suggested retail price of 189 dlrs. NetPrint is software that enables International Business Machines Corp <IBM> personal computers and compatibles print directly to Apple Computer Inc <AAPL.O> LaserWriters or other PostScript compatible printers on an AppleTalk network.         TOPS said it will begin shipping version 2.0 of its LAN software packages providing file sharing among Apple macintosh computers, IBM PCs and compatibles, and UNIX-based systems to retailers November six.     It said the TOPS/DOS version 2.0, which will have a suggested retail price of 189 dlrs, allows PCs on the network to access dedicated printers fomerly availabe to only one user.         The TOPS/Macintosh version 2.0, also listed at 189 dlrs, introduces a "remember" function that allows users to make files available to the network and access remote files automatically. In addition, the software is now fully compatible with all Apple File Protocol applications.     Both LAN's include FlashTalk, a recently announced PC-to-PC communications architecture that operates at three-times TOPS' AppleTalk speed and is slated to sell for 239 dlrs.          Reuter &#3;
