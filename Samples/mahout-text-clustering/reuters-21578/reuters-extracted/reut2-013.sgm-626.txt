BRITISH OPINION POLLS KEEP CONSERVATIVES AHEAD

Two British opinion polls showed the ruling Conservative Party would retain power with a clear majority in general elections.     A poll for commercial television, conducted after Prime Minister Thatcher returned from Moscow, this morning gave the Conservatives their highest rating since they were re-elected in 1983, with 43 pct of the votes, Labour 30 and the Social Democratic-Liberal Alliance 26 pct.     Another poll in the Times newspaper taken in 73 key marginal constituencies, predicted a Conservative majority of 92 seats.     Thatcher does not have to call elections until June 1988.
