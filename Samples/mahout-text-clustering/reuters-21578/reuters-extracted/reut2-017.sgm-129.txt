SEARS <S> RESTRUCTURES BUSINESS SYSTEMS CENTERS

Sears Roebuck and Co said it will restructure its business systems centers, which sell computer systems.     The restructuring reflects the changing personal computer market, Sears said.     Sears will consolidate 41 business systems center outlets in markets where it has more than one sales facility.     Sales and support staffs will remain intact and will report to a single location in most metropolitan areas.     When the consolidation is complete, Sears will operate 59 computer centers in 51 markets nationwide.     Some 31 markets with single sales offices will not be affected.     "We no longer need as many sales locations in each market because our sales organization will be calling directly upon our customers at their places of business," explained John H. Rollins, national manager of Sears Business Systems Centers.  Reuter &#3;
