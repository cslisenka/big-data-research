RADTECH <RADT> BOARD REMOVES CHAIRMAN

Radtech Inc said its board has removed Ronald G. Williams as chairman and chief executive officer and has elected President Samuel A. Francis chief exeuctive officer.     Williams is the majority owner of <Forum Cos Inc>. On December 12, Radtech exchanged 10 mln of its shares for 20,000 Forum shares. Of the 10 mln, 7.5 mln went to Williams and 2.5 mln to Forum's other owner, <Audley Inc>. In addition to the 10 mln shares involved in this transaction, Radtech has 9.9 mln shares outstanding.     On January 27, Radtech said, it announced an agreement to rescind the Forum transaction.     Radtech said six mln of its shares held by Williams and the 20,000 Forum shares were turned over to Radtech's attorney's. Subsequent to the rescission agreement, however, Williams and Audley have refused to recognize Radtech's position that a recission has occurred, it said.     On March 3, the company said, its attorneys filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico giving control of both blocks of stock to the court and asking it to rule on the recission.     Radtech said it intends to defend its position in the legal proceeding, which names the company, Williams and Audley, that the rescission has occurred, that all 10 mln shares it issued should be returned, and that the 600,000 dlrs of Radtech funds used by Forum should be returned.     The company also said a dispute exists whether Williams continues to serve on its board.  Reuter &#3;
