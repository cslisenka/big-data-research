BRAZIL RULING PARTY TO DECIDE ON PRESIDENTIAL TERM

The ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) will hold a national convention on July 18 and 19 to discuss the length of the Presidential term, a PMDB spokesman said.     Although the country's constitution allows for a six-year term, Sarney said he would remain only five years after he came to power in 1984.     The Constituent Assembly is drawing up a new constitution and severe economic problems have increased the pressure on it to call early elections. A faction of the PMDB favours a poll in November next year.  REUTER &#3;
