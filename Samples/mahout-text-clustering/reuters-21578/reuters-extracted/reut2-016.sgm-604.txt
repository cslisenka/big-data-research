BELL ATLANTIC <BEL> UNIT TO SELL SERVICES, GEAR

Bell Atlantic Corp's Bell of Pennsylvania unit said federal regulators granted it interim permission to sell regulated telecommunications network services along with equipment provided by an unregulated Bell Atlantic unit.     In January, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that Bell telephone companies could sell their telephone services in tandem with equipment provided by their unregulated equipment units.     But the FCC stipulated that the Bell companies must comply with new accounting rules that separate the costs of regulated telephone service from those of unregulated businesses.     Bell of Pennsylvnia said the FCC gave it interim relief to jointly market services and equipment until its accounting plan is approved by the commission.  Reuter &#3;
