CSR SAYS IT WILL MAKE MAJOR STATEMENT NEXT WEEK

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> said it expected to make an announcement next week which would have a significant and beneficial impact on the future of the company.     It said the statement was prompted by heavy turnover in CSR shares. Brokers said Bond Corp Holdings Ltd <BONA.S> today sold 24.2 mln CSR shares representing almost five pct of the company. CSR closed 20 cents higher at 4.20 dlrs on a national turnover of 31.39 mln shares.     Share analysts said the CSR announcement could be about the expected flotation of its <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd> unit, releasing cash for a major building products aquisition.     CSR forecast in January it would float Delhi and said it expected to invest close to 100 mln dlrs on acquisitions in building materials both in Australia and offshore.     One analyst, who asked not to be named, said about 25 pct of Delhi could be offered to CSR shareholders in an arrangement which would preserve the tax position of the Cooper Basin oil and gas producer, which is held in a trust.     CSR had now finished paying for Delhi, after last year writing down large foreign exchange losses on loans to buy the company and selling such investments as its share of the Mount Newman iron ore project, the analyst said.     CSR had restructured its management in recent months and was redirecting its efforts into industrial divisions from its resources business, analysts told Reuters. It could be expected to also float its coal interests, they said.     The company earlier this month said it would sell its five Sydney head office buildings.     Stuart McKibbin of Melbourne broker <A.C. Goode and Co Ltd> said CSR had till now been overlooked by many of the offshore investors now heavily buying Australian gold and resource stocks. That climate could prove an ideal time to float the CSR petroleum division, he said.  REUTER &#3;
