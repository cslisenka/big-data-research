JAPAN TO SET MICROCHIP PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said it would issue guidelines later this month for microchip production during the third quarter.     A MITI official said it was too early to say if the guidelines would call for reductions following similar government requests in the first two quarters of 1987.     "This is not a matter which should be decided on a political basis alone," the official told Reuters.     MITI asked that production of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory chips and erasable programmable read only memory chips be cut by 11 pct during the April/June quarter.     Production was cut back 10 pct in the first quarter and industry analysts said the reductions have boosted prices.     U.S. And Japanese officials met in Washington last week to discuss the removal of U.S. Sanctions against some Japanese exports but both sides agreed not to reveal the outcome of the talks, the MITI official added.     Washington imposed the sanctions in April, saying Tokyo had failed to abide by a 1986 pact on microchip trade.  REUTER &#3;
