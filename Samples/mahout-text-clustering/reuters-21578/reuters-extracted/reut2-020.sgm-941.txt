Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said it was confident in the financial markets despite the unprecedented decline in the stock market.

"We recognize that emotions run high during such a period as we are experiencing. However, now is the time when it is critical that reason and objectivity prevail," they said.  Reuter &#3;
