GREYHOUND CORP <G> DEBT AFFIRMED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service said it affirmed Greyhound Corp's Baa-2 subordinated debt rating and Prime-2 commercial paper rating. Some 160 mln dlrs of long-term debt is affected.     Moody's said Greyhound's debt had been under review for possible downgrade since May, when it agreed to acquire the in-flight catering and airport terminal concession businesses of Carson Pirie Scott and Co for about 390 mln dlrs.     Moody's said it expects Greyhound to experience generally improved results over the next several years due to recent strategic acquisitions. It has reduced debt via asset sales.  Reuter &#3;
