ROYAL BANK WARNS REGULATORY HARMONY NEEDED

Royal Bank of Canada Chairman Allan Taylor said Ottawa and the provinces risk weakening the country's financial system if they do not agree on a harmonized regulatory regime for financial institutions.     Taylor also said it was vital that the federal government  retain its existing powers under Ottawa's major new proposals to revamp the country's financial system.     "Unless great care is taken now, in the detailed drafting and implementation of regulatory change, we could actually end up weakening our financial system," Taylor told a business luncheon.     "Also, we must avoid costly and inefficient duplication of regulation and supervision between federal and provincial authorities," Taylor continued.     Earlier this week Federal Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said progress was being made with his provincial counterparts on the proposals that involve removing the traditional barriers separating the banking, securities and  insurance sectors.     The governments are attempting to resolve a jurisdictional dispute over who regulates what under the new system. The provinces have traditionally had authority in the securities field while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.     But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that  Ottawa should retain its regulatory powers to "preserve an efficient, competitive, national financial system."     On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylor said Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much access to the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.     He told a new conference later he was "reasonably confident" the Canadian side was making reciprocity in financial services an issue at the negotiating table.  Reuter &#3;
