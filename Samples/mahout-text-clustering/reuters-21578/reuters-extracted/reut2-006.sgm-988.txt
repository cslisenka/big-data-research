SAUDIS CONCLUDE STUDY ON SUBMARINE PURCHASES

Saudi Arabia's Defence and Aviation Minister was quoted as saying the kingdom had completed studies on the purchase of submarines, and tenders would be invited to supply the vessels.     The daily al-Riyadh reported Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz as saying: "A thorough study by the Ministry on the submarines has been completed and it is probable King Fahd will announce the party with which the kingdom will deal to buy them."     He gave no further details.     The London-based magazine Jane's Defence Weekly said last October the Saudi government had approached six European countries to supply between six and eight submarines at a cost of up to 2.9 billion dlrs.     It said Britain was expected to offer the Upholder submarine, made by Vickers Plc <VICK.L> and designed mainly for NATO. France, West Germany, Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands were also submitting proposals.     British Defence Secretary George Younger said during a visit to Saudi Arabia last month that the kingdom was evaluating all proposals.  REUTER &#3;
