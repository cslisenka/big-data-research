N.Y. FCOJ FUTURES SURGE, OFF HIGHS MIDDAY

Frozen concentrated orange juice futures ran up as much as 4.40 cents on frantic speculative short covering this morning, after local buying triggered buy stops in the May over 132.00 cents.     Floor traders said the market has quieted now, and prices have come off the highs as Florida trade took profits.     May rose to 133.50 cents, up 2.3 cents, before retreating to 132.90 cents at 1208 hrs EST. July climbed 4.4 cents to 133.50 cents as well, but was trading at 131.75 cents at noon.     A report showing the speculators went net short the market last week as well as liquidating longs spurred light trade buying in the morning to test speculator resolve. The trade turned sellers at the top, floor sources said.  Reuter &#3;
