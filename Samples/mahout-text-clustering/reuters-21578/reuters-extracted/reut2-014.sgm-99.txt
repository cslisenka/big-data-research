SWEDISH FINANCE FIRMS SEEN HIT BY DEREGULATION

Up to 70 pct of the 240 finance companies operating in Sweden are likely to be squeezed out over the next few years by the deregulation of financial markets, the Association of Swedish Finance Companies said.     Association chairman Arne Ogren told a news conference that a major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.     Central Bank governor Bengt Dennis said when announcing the deregulation in November 1985 that one of his main aims was to give commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms with finance companies and so undermine Sweden's "grey market."     Total credit granted by the Swedish finance companies rose to 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. This includes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of all outstanding loans by the banking sector at end-1986.     Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by a government-appointed inquiry into the credit market to license finance companies and make them increase their share capital were pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.     But he said this would in fact have little effect on credit volumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70 pct of lending by the entire sector.     The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began in the early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own to get around the tight restrictions then imposed on banking activities and particularly on the growth of lending.     Now that they were on an equal footing with their parent companies, many bank-owned finance companies faced an identity crisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers and individual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensure their survival in a deregulated climate.     Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound to rise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit.  REUTER &#3;
