U.S. EARLY MARCH CAR SALES OFF 2.2 PCT

Retail sales of new cars by U.S. automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp down 9.3 pct while Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp both had gains.     The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various plants.     Consumer incentives apparently had some success, analysts said, as the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved to 7.5 mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The eight domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.  Reuter &#3;
