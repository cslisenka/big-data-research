GM CANADA, WORKERS FAR APART IN TALKS - UNION

The Canadian unit of General Motors Corp and the union representing its 40,000 workers remain far apart over local issues in contract talks two days from a threatened strike, a union spokesman said.     The deepest divisions appeared to be between General Motors of Canada Ltd and the Canadian Auto Workers local representing 17,000 workers at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, union spokesman Wendy Cuthbertson said.     "Local 222 is miles apart," said Cuthbertson. The local assembles full-size pick-up trucks, the Buick Regal and the Pontiac 6000.     Local issues there included shift schedules, transfers and working conditions, union president Bob White said.     The union has threatened to strike at 1000 hrs EDT (1400 gmt) on Thursday unless it has reached a tentative settlement with the automaker by then.     Bargaining was scheduled to continue late into the night Tuesday in an effort to avert a walkout, said Cuthbertson.     On Monday, the union accepted an economic offer from GM Canada that largely matched the pay-and-benefit pattern reached earlier at Chrysler and Ford in Canada.  Reuter &#3;
