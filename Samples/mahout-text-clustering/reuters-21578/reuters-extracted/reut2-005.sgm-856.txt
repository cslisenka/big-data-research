STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA

Strikes against a government freeze on wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the official news agency Tanjug said last night.     It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials feared more strikes were on the way.     At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were in the northern republic of Croatia.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an annual rate of almost 100 pct.     The government froze wages at their level in the fourth quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to productivity.     The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the freeze in interviews with Tanjug.     The agency said strikes took place last week in the southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.  Reuter &#3;
