CBOE TO LIST NEW S AND P OPTIONS <NSX> APRIL 20

The Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE, said it will list new Standard and Poor 500 stock index options beginning April 20 that will trade side-by-side with the existing S and P 500 options <SPX>.     The new S and P 500 option contract differs from the existing contract in that settlement of the new contract will be based on the opening value of the index on expiration Friday. Settlement of the existing contract is based on the closing value of the index on expiration Friday.     The new opening settlement S and P 500 options will be offered only in months in which there are S and P 500 futures.     Initial months to be listed in the new options will be June, September and December, the CBOE said.     Dissemination of the settlement of price of the new options will be made through a special ticker symbol -- <SET>, the exchange said.     There will initially be seven series of strike prices for each contract month of the new options -- one strike price "at the money," or near to the actual spot index value, and three above and three below the spot index.     Position limits in any combination of both the new and existing S and P 500 options will be 15,000 contracts.     The exchange said in the rare event that a stock does not open on expiration Friday, the previous day's closing price of that stock will be used to calculate the settlement value of the index.
