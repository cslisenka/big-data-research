SOUTH AFRICA SAYS 1,500 STILL DETAINEES

South Africa said the number of people it was detaining without trial has dropped to 1,500, far fewer than previous official figures during the past year of emergency rule.     A government spokesman said the latest set of names, presented to parliament, included all current detainees who had been held for over a month. Previous lists have named up to 8,500 people.     The official figure was supported by civil rights groups who said many detainees had been freed in recent weeks, possibly to empty cells for a new government crackdown.  Reuter &#3;
