GOLDMAN, SACHS COMMENTS ON FREEMAN INDICTMENT

Goldman, Sachs and Co, responding to the indictment earlier today of Robert M. Freeman, who remains head of its risk arbitrage unit, said it believes the 44-year-old executive did not violate insider trading laws.     "Based on all we now know, we continue to believe in him and to believe that he did not act illegally," the company said in a statement.     Freeman was indicated by a federal grand jury along with two other top Wall Street executives, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor, for allegedly swapping insider information in a scheme that produced millions in illegal profits.     The company said it based in belief in Freeman's innocence on an investigation conducted by its independent outside counsel after Freeman was arrested in February.  Reuter &#3;
