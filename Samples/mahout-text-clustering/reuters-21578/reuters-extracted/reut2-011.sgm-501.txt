WHITE HOUSE SAYS STOCK MARKET SOUND AND STRONG

Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater shrugged off yesterday's sharp decline on Wall Street, saying the administration believes the stock market is "fundamentally sound."     Fitzwater attributed Monday's 57 point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average at the closing bell to "technical decisions" and said President Reagan's decision to impose trade sanctions against Japan might have also contributed.     "There are a lot of reasons that can cause this, but the underlying fact is that we believe the market is very strong and sound," he said.     Fitzwater said the stock market had risen 239 pct since Reagan took office on January 20, 1981.     "The market, we believe, is fundamentally sound," he said.     The presidential spokesman noted that at mid-day, the market had recovered some of the losses that occurred on Monday, when the third-worst one-day slump in Wall Street history occurred.
