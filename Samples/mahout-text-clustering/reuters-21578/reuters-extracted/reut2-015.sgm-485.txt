G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     At a news conference after yesterday's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said.     He said this test of the G-7 nations' resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.  Reuter &#3;
