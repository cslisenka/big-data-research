ATT <T> PROPOSES NEW SIMPLIFIED REGULATIONS

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it is proposing a new simplified approach to regulating the long-distance telecommunications market.     In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, ATT proposed replacing the current rate of return regulation with simplified rules that "would eliminate many costs now imposed on customers while freeing ATT to introduce new services and pricing options more swiftly."     The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp said the firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principal long-distance competitor, ATT.     Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would commit to continue providing basic long-distance services to all customers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in all parts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to do otherwise.     Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the company to file tariffs for new interstate services and price changes that would go into effect within 14 days.     In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of the voluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time it introduces or changes long-distance services.     The new proposal would place the burden on challengers to demonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".     It would also require long-distance companies to submit periodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in the industry.     Lawrence Garfinkel, ATT's Vice-President of Marketing Services, said, "With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely tuned, targeted approach."
