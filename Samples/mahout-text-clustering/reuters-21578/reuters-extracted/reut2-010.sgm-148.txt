SEALED POWER <SPW>, GENERAL MOTORS<GM> SIGN PACT

Sealed Power Corp, an automotive parts producer and distributor, said its Kent-Moore Group has signed a memorandum of understanding with General Motors which would allow the group to distribute and market GM's Dealer Equipment service.     Sealed Power said the GM Dealer Equipment service evaluates various types of equipment for GM dealerships, authorizes suppliers to produce certain GM-branded items, merchandises GM and other selected equipment to dealers and consults with dealers on their service systems requirements.     "Kent-Moore will assume responsibility for the advertised dealer contact number...providing 'one stop shopping' for both special tools and state-of-the-art service equipment," Robert Bishop, Sealed Power group vice president, said.     GM Dealer Equipment will continue to evaluate and select the major service equipment items and the "GM Dealer Equipment" logo will still be used on specified service equipment, Sealed Power said.
