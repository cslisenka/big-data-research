DEERE <DE> AND UNIT DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it downgraded 1.8 billion dlrs of long-term debt of Deere and Co and its finance unit John Deere Credit Co.     Downgraded were senior notes and debentures to Baa-2 from A-3 and subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-1. The senior debt includes John Deere Credit Co's guaranteed Eurobonds.     Moody's cited lower agricultural equipment demand due to depressed conditions in the farm economy. It also noted that equipment prices are pressured by competition. Deere is the industry's dominant producer but overcapacity keeps cash flow and debt protection measures under pressure, Moody's noted.  Reuter &#3;
