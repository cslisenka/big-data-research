ARIZONA NUCLEAR PLANT SHUTDOWN DUE TO WATER LEAK

The Palo Verde Unit 1 nuclear power plant was removed from service Sunday due to a leaking pipe in its circulating water system, according to the plant's operator, the Arizona Nuclear Power Project.     It said the pipe, on the non-nuclear, steam-generating side of the plant, delivers water to the plant's condenser. This water is used to condense steam to drive the turbine generator, the Power Project said.     The cause of the leak is being investigated and no time estimate was given for when the unit will return to service, it said, adding Unit 2 is operating at full power.     The Arizona Nuclear Power Project is a consortium of southwest U.S. utilities including AZP Group's <AZP> Arizona Public Service, El Paso Electric <ELPA>, Public Service of New Mexico <PNM> and Southern California Edison <SCE>.
