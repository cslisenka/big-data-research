CRAZY EDDIE <CRZY.O> REMAINS ON S/P CREDITWATCH

The company's implied senior debt rating is BB-minus.

Crazy Eddie has yet to respond to two competing takeover bids, one by founder and chairman Eddie Antar with First City Capital Corp and a second for about 235 mln dlrs by Entertainment Marketing Inc, S and P noted.
