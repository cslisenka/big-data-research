COMPAQ <CPQ> AWARDED 1988 GSA CONTRACT

Compaq Computer Corp said the General Service Administration has awarded it a contract allowing federal agencies to purchase COMPAQ personal computers until March 31, 1988. The previous Compaq GSA contract expired March 31.     Under the new agreement, federal agencies can order the COMPAQ presonal computers through any one of 1,400 authorized COMPAQ computer government dealers without going through time-consuming competitive bids.     Puchases of over 300,000 dlrs, however, must still be bid competitively, Compaq said.  Reuter &#3;
