MALAWI INTRODUCES NEW TAXES TO BOOST REVENUE

Malawi will impose a 15 pct "border tax" on some overseas remittances and a five pct profit tax for local branches of foreign firms to boost revenue and meet a projected 1987/88 budget deficit of 303 mln kwacha, the Malawi news agency reported.     Finance Minister Dalton Katopola, presenting the new budget, said other measures would include raising surtax on goods and services by five points to 35 pct and imposing duty on luxury goods and tax on statutory bodies such as the Water Board.
