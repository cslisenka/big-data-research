DASSAULT OFFERS NEW PLANE TO DEFENCE MINISTRY

Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation <AVMD.PA> has offered the French Defence Ministry a new design of its Rafale fighter which is lighter and less detectible by radar, a company spokesman said today.     The new version would weigh between 8.5 and nine tonnes unarmed against 9.5 tonnes for the existing Rafale-A demonstrator which first flew last year, he said.     The Rafale-D design calls for special paints and materials to absorb radar signals, as well as smoother contours and electronic counter-measures.  Reuter &#3;
