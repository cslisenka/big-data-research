ROSTENKOWSKI QUESTIONS SECURITIES TAX

U.S. House Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he questioned whether a U.S. Tax on securities transactions would be appropriate.     Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, told Reuters before addressing the Future Industry Association that such a tax could impair the international competitiveness of the U.S. Securities business.     House Speaker James Wright, a Democrat of Texas, has said a tax on securities transactions could help reduce the federal deficit.     Rostenkowski said he understood that Britain was exploring the possibility of easing its tax burden on securities firms and in that context a new U.S. Tax would be especially hard felt by the domestic industry.
