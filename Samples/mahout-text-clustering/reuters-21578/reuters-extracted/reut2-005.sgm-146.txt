BANK OF CHINA INCREASES CAPITAL

The Bank of China, the state foreign exchange and foreign trade bank, has increased its capital to five billion yuan from three billion yuan, the New China News Agency said.     The bank's board of directors meeting here announced that the increased funds had been allocated to the bank last December.     The meeting approved the bank's 1986 balance sheet, showing total assets of 345 billion yuan by end-1986. No comparative figure was given for 1985.     A bank spokesman said the increased capital would enhance its position at a time of rapidly expanding business.     By end-1986, the bank had 369 domestic institutions and 347 elsewhere including Hong Kong and Macao.  REUTER &#3;
