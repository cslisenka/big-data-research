ZENITH ELECTRONICS <ZE> TO BRING JOBS TO U.S.

Zenith Electronics Corp said ratification of a new union contract on Sunday will enable the company to bring some jobs back from Mexico to its color television manufacturing factory in Springfield, Mo.     The company did not specify the number of jobs.     It said a new contract ratified by members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers will reduce wages 8.1 pct in the first three years of the pact. Zenith said the contract, replacing an earlier one that was to expire in March 1988, assures it will keep 600 assembly jobs from going to Mexico.  Reuter &#3;
