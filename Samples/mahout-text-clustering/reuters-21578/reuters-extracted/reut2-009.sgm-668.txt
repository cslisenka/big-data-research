USACAFES <USF> UNIT POSTS RECORD WEEKLY SALES

USACafes LP said sales at its Bonanza Restaurant unit rose 16.6 pct to a record 10.4 mln dlrs for the week ended March 22.     That compares with sales of 8,909,000 dlrs for the comparable week last year, the partnership said.     USACafes, which said year-to-date sales from the Bonanza chain were up 13 pct, attributed the increase to the budget steakhouse chain's decision to add chicken, seafood and salad entrees to its menu.     It said the new entrees now account for two-thirds of the chain's sales.  Reuter &#3;
