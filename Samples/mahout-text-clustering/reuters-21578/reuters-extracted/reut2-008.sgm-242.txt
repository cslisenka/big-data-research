ICN PHARMACEUTICALS <ICN> TO BUY BACK SHARES

ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc said its board approved the purchase of up to three mln shares of its outstanding common stock.     ICN also said it plans to buy up to 500,000 more shares each of Viratek Inc <VIRA> and SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc <SPIP>.     ICN said the buyback plans were approved because the board believed that at current prices the investment represented by the ICN group itself is in the best interests of the shareholders of the company.
