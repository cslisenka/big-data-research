LONDON COCOA STANDS HARDLY CHANGED AT MIDDAY

Cocoa futures stood hardly changed from last night at midday with near July last traded at yesterday's offered level of 1,318 stg from a 1,324 high, dealers said.     Overnight steadiness in New York was balanced by firm sterling versus the dollar and continued availability of West African new crop physical offers, notably Ghana and Ivory.     The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was offering around 1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, dealers said.     Volume midday was 1,013 lots including 130 crosses.     Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the near future, the only other bullish feature on the immediate horizon is the recently lower trade forecast for Bahia's temporao crop which ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mln bags from 2.0 to 2.5 mln bags previously and compared with initial expectations of three mln bags, dealers said.     Some traders are now saying the temporao is more likely to be near the lower end of the new range although this could be offset by a higher than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop.     Resale physicals were quiet although light enquiry was seen, the dealers said.  REUTER &#3;
