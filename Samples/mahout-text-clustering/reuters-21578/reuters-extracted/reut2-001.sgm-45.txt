HALLWOOD GROUP <HWG> OFFICIAL GET SAXON POST

Saxon Oil Development Partners' Saxon Oil Co said its chairman Bill Saxon and chief executive officer Steven Saxon have resigned effective immediately.     Saxon said Anthony Gumbiner, chairman and chief executive officer of The Hallwood Group Inc, succeeds Bill Saxon as chairman.     Hallwood owns a substantial number of shares of preferred stock in Saxon which, if converted into common stock, would constitute approximately 37 pct of the company, according to a source.     Hallwood specializes in bailing out financially troubled companies and restructuring their debt, according to the source. In exchange sometimes, the group receives a small portion of the company's common stock.     At times, the group also receives a position in the company, as was the case at Saxon, the source explained.  Reuter &#3;
