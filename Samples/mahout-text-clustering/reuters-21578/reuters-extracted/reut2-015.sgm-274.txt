INSPIRATION RESOURCES VENTURE PLANS TO GO PUBLIC

Mingold Resources, a newly formed gold company equally owned by Inspiration Resources Corp <IRC> and <Minorco Canada Ltd>, said it plans to be a publicly traded, self-financing gold mining company within three to four years.     Mingold currently manages Hudson Bay Gold Inc and Farley Gold Inc, both wholly owned units of Inspiration.     The company said Hudson Bay and Minorco have agreed to explore and, if warranted, to develop the Metalore gold property near Beardmore, Ontario, after Metalore satisfactorily settles an action filed against it by <Ontex Resources Ltd>. A work program that includes drilling will begin shortly, Mingold said.  Reuter &#3;
