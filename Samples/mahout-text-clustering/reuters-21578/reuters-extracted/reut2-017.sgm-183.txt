ALEXANDER'S <ALX> SERVED WITH COMPLAINTS

Alexander's Inc said that although no proposal has been received, the company has been served with several shareholder complaints challenging the 47-dlr-a-share acquisition price under consideration by Donald Trump and Interstate Properties.     Alexander's chairman Robin Farks said that an announcement made earlier this month indicated that no assurance could be given that Trump and Interstate would reach any agreement regarding an acquisition of the company, or what price might be offered.
