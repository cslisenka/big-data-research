INTEGRATED GENERICS <IGN> TO MAKE STATEMENT

Integrated Generics Inc president Elliot Friedman told Reuters the company plans to make a statement late Thursday or early Friday.     Trading in the generic drug company's stock was halted today by the American Stock Exchange because of a pending announcement, the exchange said.     The announcement will deal with several events that are "favorable," Friedman said but declined to elaborate. The announcement will not be ready until late tomorrow or early Friday, he said.     Shares of the Bellport, N.Y. maker and distributor of generic drugs closed at 5-3/8 yesterday, unchanged. They were trading up 3/8 at 5-3/4 before the halt.  Reuter &#3;
