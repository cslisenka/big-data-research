IRAN SAYS IT OPENS NEW OFFENSIVE NORTH OF BAGHDAD

Iran said it launched a fresh offensive today north of Baghdad, three days after it began a new thrust against Iraq on the southern Gulf war front.     The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the offensive began before dawn northeast of Qasr-e-Shirin, on the border 110 miles northeast of the Iraqi capital.     "Heavy casualties and losses have been inflicted on Iraqi forces in the fresh Iranian assault," IRNA said.     Iran today reported major gains on the southern front near the major Iraqi port city of Basra, saying its forces had captured an important defensive line.  REUTER &#3;
