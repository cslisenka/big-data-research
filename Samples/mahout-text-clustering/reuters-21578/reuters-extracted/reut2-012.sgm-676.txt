In January, the company said it was holding talks with potential buyers for the sale of the businesses but then said in February it was studying the transfer of the businesses to a master limited partnership.     R.J. Reynolds said it will continue to sell the brands until July three.     On March six, RJR completd the sale of its Heublein Inc unit to Grand Metropolitan PLC for 1.2 billion dlrs. It said it would use proceeds from that sale to redeem its 11.20 pct notes due Aug 1, 1997.  Reuter &#3;
