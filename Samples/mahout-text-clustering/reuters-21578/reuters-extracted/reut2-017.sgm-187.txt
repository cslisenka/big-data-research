SOVIET GOVT SAYS ECONOMIC RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY

The Soviet government said economic results achieved in the first three months of the year were unsatisfactory, the official news agency Tass said.     Soviet industrial production from January to March grew by 2.5 pct compared with the same period last year, but fell short of its target by 0.8 pct, official statistics showed.     "The Council of Ministers (government) emphasised that the results did not meet the Communist Party's exacting demands for the radical reconstruction of the economy," Tass said. "The first quarter economic results were deemed unsatisfactory."      It singled out failings in the engineering, chemical and timber industriess, as well as light industry.  Reuter &#3;
