DISNEY <DIS> FRENCH DISNEYLAND DEAL DEFINITIVE

Walt Disney Co said it has signed a definitive agreement with the French government to build and operate Euro Disneyland on 5,000 acres at Marne-la-Vallee, a new town 20 miles east of Paris.     The company said construction is scheduled to start next year and the theme park portion of the development -- which will also include a resort and recreation complex -- will take about four years to build.  The theme park is expected to attract at least 10 mln visitors a year, Disney said.     The company said Euro Disneyland will offer a Magic Kingdom theme park like those at its Anaheim, Calif., Orlando, Fla., and Tokyo complexes and peripheral resort and recreation facilities similar to those at Walt Disney World in Orlando.     Disney said it will seek other equity investors in Euro Disneyland from France and elsewhere in the world.     It said provisions for a second theme park on the property are included in the understanding with the French government, which is selling Disney the land.  In Orlando, Disney also operates EPCOT Center.     The company said long-term plans include convention facilities, a business park, an office complex and other related tourist developments.     Disney said the French government will extend the Paris Metro subway system to the park and build interchanges and raods to provide superhighway access.     It said it will receive royalties based on gross revenues from admissions, food and merchandise and will receive a fee to operate Magic Kingdom and other resort elements under a management contract.  Disney said Eruo Disneyland will operate year-round.  Reuter &#3;
