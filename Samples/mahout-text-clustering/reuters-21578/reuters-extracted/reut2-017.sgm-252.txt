KLOECKNER-WERKE SHARES SUSPENDED IN FRANKFURT

Shares in Kloeckner-Werke AG <KLKG.F> were suspended from stock exchange trading pending an announcement expected by the company today or tomorrow, a bourse spokesman said, without giving further details.     Kloeckner shares closed Friday at 67.20 marks. They had come under pressure in recent sessions on reports the company may be exposed to as much as 300 mln marks in debts as a result of the bankruptcy of steelmaker Eisenwerk-Gesellschaft Maximilanshuette mbH (Maxhuette).     Kloeckner owns just over 49 pct of the share capital in the Bavarian-based Maxhuette.  REUTER &#3;
