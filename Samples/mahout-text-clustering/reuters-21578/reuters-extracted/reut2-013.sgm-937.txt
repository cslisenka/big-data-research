WALL STREET STOCKS LOWER IN EARLY TRADING

Wall Street stocks rebounded from their early lows as the dollar firmed. Shares of automakers scored a second straight session of strong gains, and expectations of rising oil prices today sent many energy issues higher, traders said.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell more than 10 points in the first minutes of trading this morning when the dollar weakened and bond prices eased, recovered to post an 11 point gain to 2416. Advances led declines by only a slight margin on volume of 48 mln shares. GM gained two to 83-1/2 and Ford 5/8 to 90-3/4. Chrysler rose 3/8 to 58-5/8.  Reuter &#3;
