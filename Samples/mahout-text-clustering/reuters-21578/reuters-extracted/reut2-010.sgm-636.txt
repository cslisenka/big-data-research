FRENCH PUBLIC SECTOR TO GET FIVE BILLION FRANCS

The French public sector will get a total of five billion francs of investment from the 41 billion francs which the government expects to raise through its privatisation program, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said in a televised interview on Wednesday the successful program would net the government 10 billion francs, more than the 30 billion orignally estimated.     Around 75 pct of the additional revenue will be used to cut state debt and 25 pct for public sector investment.     Of this investment envelope, a total of 800,000 francs will go towards industrial modernisation, especially of the chemical sector and and a further 800,000 francs for high-tech industries such as the aeronautical and electronic sectors, the Finance Ministry said.     France's state railways, the SNCF, will receive 1.4 billion francs to speed up financing of the high-speed TGV rail link to the Atlantic coast.     A total of two billion francs will go towards improving motorways around the country, the ministry said.  REUTER &#3;
