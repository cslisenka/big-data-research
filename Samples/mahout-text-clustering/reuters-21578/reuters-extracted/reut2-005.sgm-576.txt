NEW SENATOR BACKS U.S. FARM DECOUPLING PROPOSALS

New Nebraska Republican Senator David Karnes said he supports proposals to "decouple" farm subsidies from production decisions.     Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. in Omaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).     On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradual reductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should be continued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts in target prices each year are "excessive."     Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls for major crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supported mandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm bill provision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.     Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention earlier today and spoke to Reuters after Boschwitz addressed the NGFA meeting.     Karnes said he is seeking a seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee but no decision has been made on the request.     Karnes, who has not held political office before, was appointed by Nebraska Republican Governor Kay Orr. He will be up for election in 1988.  Reuter &#3;
