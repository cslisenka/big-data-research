FRENCH FARMERS WORRIED OVER FUTURE OF CAP

The French farmers' union, FNSEA, hopes France will resist European Community (EC) pressures over farm prices and notably those of the European Commission at coming ministerial negotiations in Brussels, FNSEA Secretary-General Luc Guyau said.     He told a press conference the union was concerned about the future of the EC Common Agricultural Policy.     France must define its position well before negotiating and not just adopt a short term policy, he said.     The FNSEA, with around 700,000 members, holds its annual congress next week, when over 500 delegates will debate the theme of "facing up to the future.     "The period of change we are going through obliges us to face up to new challenges," Guyau said, referring specifically to the demographic changes in French agriculture.     "Forty-five per cent of our farmers are over 55 years old this year," he said.  REUTER &#3;
