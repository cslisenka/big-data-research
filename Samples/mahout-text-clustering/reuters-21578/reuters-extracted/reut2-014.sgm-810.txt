ASIAN DOLLAR DEPOSITS OPEN QUIETLY MIXED

Asian dollar deposit rates opened narrowly mixed in quiet trading, dealers said.     They said the market ignored dollar supportive comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minsiter Kiichi Miyazawa.     The U.S. Federal Reserve's addition of temporary reserves via two-day system repurchase agreements when fed funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct also had little effect on the market.     Short-dates were unchanged to slightly higher underpinned by a steady U.S. Fed funds rate.  Overnight was little changed at 6-5/16 6-3/16 and week-fixed rose 1/16 point to 6-3/8 6-1/4.     Dealers said most operators refrained from taking large positions as they await more news from the expected currency talks in Washington starting today.     Among period rates, one month eased 1/16 point to 6-7/16 6-5/16 pct, three and six months were unchanged at 6-9/16 6-7/16 and 6-11/16 6-9/16 pct, respectively while one year gaind 1/16 point to 6-7/8 6-3/4 pct.     Asian dollar CD rates opened mixed in quiet trading. One month slipped to 6.40/30 pct from 6.45/35 yesterday, three months was steady at 6.55/45 pct but six months rose slightly to 6.70/60 pct from 6.65/55.  REUTER &#3;
