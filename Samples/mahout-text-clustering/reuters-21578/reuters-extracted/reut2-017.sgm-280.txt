NEW POLL PUTS BRITISH CONSERVATIVES WELL AHEAD

Britain's ruling Conservatives maintained a commanding lead in a new opinion poll, reinforcing views that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is poised to call a general election in June.     The Harris poll published in the Observer newspaper gave the Conservatives the support of 42 pct of those questioned, Labour 31 pct, and the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance trailing with 25 pct.     This would give the Conservatives a 94-seat overall majority in the House of Commons.  Reuter &#3;
