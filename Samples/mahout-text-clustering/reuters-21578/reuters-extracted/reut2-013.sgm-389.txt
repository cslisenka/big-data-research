YEN BOND FUTURES CLOSE SHARPLY HIGHER

Yen bond futures prices closed sharply higher reflecting the steep advance in cash bond prices on purchases by end-investors and banks' dealing accounts, which was followed by broker buying, dealers said.     Key June ended at 110.68 against the 109.93 finish yesterday after opening at 110.25 and rising to a high of 110.75. September ended at 109.40 against 108.74.     Short-term rates dropped by one point in response to a seasonal surplus of some 400 billion yen, money traders said. City and trust bank dealing acounts actively bought low coupon cash issues, accelerating the futures rally, dealers said.     Most currency dealers here believe the dollar will remain bearish despite the expected Group of Seven meeting in Washington tomorrow.     Should the dollar fall further, Japan might have to ease its credit policy, which would lend support to the market, bond dealers said.     The unconditional yen call rate was 3.6250 pct today, up from 3.6875 yesterday. The two-month commercial bill discount rate was 3.8750 pct, up from 3.9375. The three-month certificate of deposit rate, the representative open money market rate, was 4.14/03, up from 4.18/06 yesterday.  REUTER &#3;
