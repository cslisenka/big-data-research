OPPOSITION SAYS UK GOV'T GAVE ARMS TO CONTRAS

A leading member of Britain's opposition Labour Party said there was strong evidence Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher approved the sale of anti- aircraft missiles to Nicaraguan Contra rebels during talks last year with U.S. Officials involved in the Iran arms scandal.     Labour foreign affairs spokesman George Foulkes told parliament the U.S. Tower Commission report on the sale of arms to Iran showed Colonel Oliver North had tried to obtain 20 Blowpipe missiles and 10 launchers through a South American country from a Belfast-based company, Short Brothers, which manufactures the missiles.     Short Brothers is owned by the British Government.     Junior Foreign Officer Minister Timothy Eggar dismissed the claims as "wild and fanciful allegations" with no foundation.     Foulkes said North testified he was seeking the help of "a head of an allied government" in obtaining the Blowpipes and suggested the supply of missiles was discussed during two meetings which he said took place between North, the then head of the CIA William Casey and Thatcher in 1986.     "We need to know what happened at those meetings between Mr Casey, Colonel North and the Prime Minister last year. What were they talking about if it were not the supply of Blowpipe missiles to the Contra terrorists?" Foulkes said.  Reuter &#3;
