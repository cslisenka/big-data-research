Scott Instruments Corp said it has decided to concentrate on marketing new applications of its existing research.     It said it will realize cost savings from the reduction of manufacturing and marketing staff and overhead expenses.     The company said it will seek to license its Coretechs Vet 3 speech recognition product to other companies and have them provide manufacturing, market development, distribution and support activities in the industrial market.     It said it is near completion of talks for a British company to distribute Vet 3 in Britain and Europe.  Reuter &#3;
