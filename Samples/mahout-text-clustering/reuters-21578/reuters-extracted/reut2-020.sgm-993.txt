ATT <T> SUPPORTS FCC PLAN ON PRICE CEILINGS

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said it supported the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) plan to establish price ceilings for ATT long-distance services as a replacement for current regulation.     The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4 that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation, which has been in place for the past 20 years.         ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industry has made obsolete rate-of-return, which stipulates that a company can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 12.2 pct -- on its investment.     The company termed the price cap a "transitional step," and said it hoped the FCC would support a program of regulatory oversight, which would consist of a streamlined tariff process.
