GENERALE OCCIDENTALE SEEKS 100 MLN DLR FACILITY

Generale Occidentale, Paris, has mandated Orion Royal Bank Ltd to arrange a 100 mln dlr revolving credit facility, Orion said.     Borrowings under the seven-year facility can be in dollars or other currencies where available. Drawings will be at 3/8 pct over the London interbank offered rate for one, three or six months or at 1/8 pct over Royal Bank of Canada's U.S. Prime rate for periods of one to 30 days.     There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on the unutilised available amount and 1/8 pct on the amount designated as unavailable.     Proceeds from the facility will be used to refinance an existing loan facility and provide a flexible source of finance for general corporate purposes.     Generale Occidentale, a rare borrower in the international capital markets, is engaged in food distribution, forestry, oil production and media activities with interests in Europe and North America.
