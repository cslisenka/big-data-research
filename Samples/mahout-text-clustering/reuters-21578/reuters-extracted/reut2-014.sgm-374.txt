BOESKY AIDE AGREES TO STOCK TRADING PENALTIES

Michael Davidoff, head trader for Ivan Boesky's Seemala Corp, consented to Securities and Exchange Commission penalities and agreed to help in its continuing investigation of insider trading, the SEC said.     Davidoff recently pleaded guilty in federal court to violating the net capital requirements governing brokers and traders.     The SEC had filed similar charges and it said Davidoff had consented to a final judgement enjoing him from future stock trading violations.     The SEC said Davidoff consented to its order without admitting or denying the allegations that he aided and abetted violations by a broker and dealer.     It also said Davidoff consented to a planned SEC order to bar him from future securities dealings.  reuter &#3;
