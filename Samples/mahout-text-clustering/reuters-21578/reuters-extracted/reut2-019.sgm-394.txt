CHRYSLER <C> AND FINANCIAL UNIT AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed the debt ratings of Chrysler Corp and Chrysler Financial Corp following the automaker's agreement to acquire Electrospace Systems Inc for 367 mln dlrs.     It said the acquisition could easily be funded from existing cash balances, still leaving Chrysler with an adequate level of precautionary cash.     At March 31 Chrysler had 2.9 billion dlrs of cash and marketable securities, up from 2.7 billion dlrs at year-end 1986, S and P noted.     Standard and Poor's affirmed the BBB senior debt of Chrysler and Chrysler Financial. Also affirmed were the finance arm's BBB-minus subordinated debt and A-2 commercial paper.     Electrospace makes communications and electronic systems for aerospace applications. Because of the company's relatively small size, the acquisition should have little effect on Chrysler's balance sheet, S and P said.  Reuter &#3;
