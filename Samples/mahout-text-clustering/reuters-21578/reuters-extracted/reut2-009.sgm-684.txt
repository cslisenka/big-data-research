PALO VERDE UNIT 3 GRANTED OPERATING LICENSE

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a low-power operating license to Unit 3 of the Palo Verde nuclear plant, plant's owners said.     Owners of the Palo Verde plant include AZP Group's Arizona Public Service Co unit, which holds a 29.1 pct interest, and Southern California Edison <SCE> and El Paso Electric Co, which each own a 15.8 pct stake.    The owners said the license will allow for fueling and testing of up to five pct of the plant's power. Fueling will begin in a few days, they said.     The commission must review the results of the low-power testing before it can approve full-power operation.     The owners of plant said they expect to begin full-power operation by the end of 1987.      Reuter &#3;
