WANG LABS <WAN> BETTER NET ON INCREASED REVENUES

Wang Laboratories Inc expects revenues for the year ending June 30, 1988, to increase 12 to 15 pct over fiscal 1987 to 3.2 billion dlrs, President Frederick Wang said.     He told a news conference after-tax profit for the year should increase by three to five pct.     Earlier Wang said first quarter revenues increased 16 to 693 mln dlrs and profits totaled 22.5 mln dlrs, or 14 cts a share, vs a loss of 30 mln dlrs, or 19 cts a share, in the September quarter last year.         Wang told the news conference the company's orders were particularly strong for the high end of its line of VS minicomputers.     "For the past six months the high end really surged" while the company's entry level computers dipped slightly, senior vice president of U.S. operations Ian Diery said.     For the past six months, earnings for both large and entry level systems in the U.S. increased by 20 pct, he said..     Wang said the company has seen an overall resurgance in its business in the U.S. He said the company's business in Europe "remains fairly firm."  Reuter &#3;
