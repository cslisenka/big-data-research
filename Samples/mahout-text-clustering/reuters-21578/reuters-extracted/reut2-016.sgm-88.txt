JUDGE KEEPS JAL <JAPN.T> CRASH SUIT ALIVE IN U.S.

A judge ruled that questions of liability in the 1985 crash of a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 which killed 520 people near Tokyo will be decided in Seattle.     But he left open the possibility that monetary damages could be awarded in a Japanese court.     The ruling, by King County Superior Court Judge Gary Rittle, came in a hearing on lawsuits in which survivors of 77 of the victims are seeking millions of dollars in compensation.     Rittle said after the liability problems are settled, he will examine the question of where damages will be decided.     Lawyers for both the airline and the Seattle-based Boeing Co (BA.N> argued that the suits should be handled in a Japanese court, saying it would be more costly and time-consuming to hear them in an American court.     But lawyers for the victims' survivors said the two companies were trying to evade the liability question and reduce the amount of compensation they may have to pay.     Court officials said the case was likely to go to trial here in eight to 10 months.     A draft report by a Japanese Transport Ministry investigation team said faulty repairs in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by ministry inspectors had contributed to the cause of the disaster.     The report, obtained by Reuters this week, is expected to be made public next month. Boeing has said it will probably not comment on the report until it is officially released.  REUTER &#3;
