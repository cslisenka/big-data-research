GRACE <GRA> PLANS TO APPEAL 100 MLN DLR JUDGMENT

W.R. Grace and Co said a federal district court jury in Chicago has ordered it to pay 100 mln dlrs in damages, based on a judgment involving a loan agreement with Continental Illinois National Bank <CIL>.     The company said the damages consist of 25 mln dlrs in compensatory damages and 75 mln dlrs in punitive damages.     It said it will appeal the ruling. The company said the litigation "involved an interpretation of a complex financing arrangement entered into with Continental Illinois National Bank <CIL> which transferred the loan to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp upon restructuring of the bank."     The company said it believes the appeal will be successful.     Separately, it said it has resumed the periodic purchases of up to 2.3 mln shares of Grace common stock in unsolicited open market and privately negotiated transactions.     The company has about 42.2 mln common shares outstanding.  Reuter &#3;
