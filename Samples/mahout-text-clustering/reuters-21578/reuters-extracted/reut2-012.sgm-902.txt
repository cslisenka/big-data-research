PRAXIS <PRAX> AIDS DRUG TO GO INTO WIDER TESTS

Praxis Pharmaceuticals Inc, which owns worldwide licensing rights to the promising AIDS treatment AL721, said large scale tests of the drug are planned for this summer in the United States.     Arnold Lippa, Praxis' president, said Praxis will test the drug in a few hundred patients with full-blown AIDS, in those with AIDS-related complex, a precursor to AIDS, and in more patients with swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS symptoms.     Praxis reported a net loss of 2,186,000 dlrs for the year ended June 30, 1986. Lippa said the firm has about two mln dlrs left from its public offering in January 1985.     But Lippa expects to "easily spend" five to 10 mln dlrs in these new clinical trials. He said the Beverly-Hills, Calif.-based company is preparing a private offering and discussing ventures with other pharmaceutical firms to help finance the cost of the trials.     As another mark of the interest in AL721, Anthony S. Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the government will begin testing AL721 in its AIDS treatment evaluation units in June.     A spokeswoman said the study will be "small" and will establish the drug's toxicity. She said the study will be "expedited" to allow the next phase of testing to proceed rapidly.     These plans follow the completion of a small-scale test of the drug's effectiveness in eight patients with AIDS-related lymphadenopathy--swollen lymph glands, at St. Lukes/Roosevelt Hospital in New York, and another study of 14 AIDS patients in Israel, where the drug was developed.
