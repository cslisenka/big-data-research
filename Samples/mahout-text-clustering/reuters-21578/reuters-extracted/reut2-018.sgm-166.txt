GREENSPAN SEEN AS STRONG INFLATION FIGHTER

Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated to replace Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is regarded by financial analysts as a conservative economist who will take a strong stand against inflation.     "He'll be a strong fighter against inflation," said Martin Regalia, director of research and economics at the National Council of Savings Institutions.     Greenspan has broad experience both in running his own private economic consulting firm - Townsend-Greenspan - and in government service. He was President Ford's top economic adviser, serving as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from September 1974 until January 1977.     During that time, inflation rising above 10 percent, a was a major political concern during Ford's administration.     "He's had a lot of experience with inflation, and as an inflation fighter," Richard Medley, partner with Smick-Medley and Associates, said of Greenspan. "He had that seared into his memory during that period," Medley added.  Reuter &#3;
