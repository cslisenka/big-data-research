AIRLINE FARE DISCLOSURE BILL PROPOSED IN SENATE

Angered by late flights and complicated restrictions on discount air fares, a senator has introduced legislation to make airlines provide more details on fares and schedules in their advertisements.     Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the bill's sponsor, said airline ads now are often misleading because they do not give prospective passengers enough facts about discount fares.     "Air travelers are lured by low advertised fares which simply aren't available," the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement. "It's the old bait and switch."     Airline advertisements usually say discount seats are limited, but Lautenberg said more information was needed.  Reuter &#3;
