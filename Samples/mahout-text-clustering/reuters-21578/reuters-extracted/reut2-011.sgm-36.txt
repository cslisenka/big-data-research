HIGH COURT DECLINES TO REVIEW AIR BAG RULE

The Supreme Court declined to review a federal regulation requiring automobile manufacturers to phase in automatic seat belts or air bags for new cars sold in the United States.     The Department of Transportation (DOT) rule required that the safety devices be installed, for the first time, on 10 pct of this year's model cars. All new cars must have the devices by the 1990-model year.     The regulation, however, can be rescinded if states with two-thirds of the U.S. population adopt mandatory seat belt-use laws by 1989.
