GM <GM> TO CLOSE NORWOOD PLANT IN AUGUST

General Motors Corp said it will cease production at its Norwood, Ohio, car assembly plant effective August 26 to reduce output of the sporty CHevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models built there.     "After careful review and analysis of our capacitry requirements, it has become necessary for us to close Norwood at the end of the 1987 model year," GM vice-president and group executive Robert Schultz said.     GM previously said it would close the plant in a capacity reduction, but did not specify a precise date. The cars will still be built at GM's Van Nuys, Calif., plant.  Reuter &#3;
