LIVE HOG FUTURES HIGHER EARLY

Live Hog futures ran up for gains of 0.57 to 0.07 cent in eary trade paced by April and June.     Fairly active demand reflected strength in cash hogs and the continued discount of futures to cash. The start of fieldwork limited farmer movement of hogs to market and prompted packers to bid up for hogs. Mostly steady to firm cash pork products added to support, traders said.     However, prices slipped from the highs in latest trade as commercial profit-taking developed. Some selling was also attributed to expectations that cash ham prices will be falling soon on a seasonal basis, they said.     Thomson and RBH bought while Packers Trading and Refco sold. Stotler spread long June/short April, they added.  Reuter &#3;
