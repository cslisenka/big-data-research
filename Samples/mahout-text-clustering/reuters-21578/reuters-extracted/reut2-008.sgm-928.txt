BALLADUR SAYS ECONOMIC REBOUND TO TAKE YEARS

France's economic recovery will take several years, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur told the Economic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body composed of industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy.     "We will bear for long years to come the weight of the choices made at the start of the oil crisis about 15 years ago, unfavorable choices for industries but favorable for households," he said without elaborating.     "It is the cost of this choice that our industries are still having to bear. We must improve their competitivity to regain growth and employment," Balladur added.     Balladur said the French budget deficit must be reduced to below 70 billion francs from 129 billion forecast for 1987 but he gave no time-scale. He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.     He said France's public debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year compared with 1,300 billion francs in 1986, must not increase by more than between 60 to 70 billion francs a year.     He reaffirmed that income from the government's sweeping privatization program, seen to be at least 30 billion francs for 1987, must be used mainly to pay off French state debt and not to finance current needs.
