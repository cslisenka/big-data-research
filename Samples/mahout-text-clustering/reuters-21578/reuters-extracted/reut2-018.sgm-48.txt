VOLCKER IN LETTER DECLINES NEW FED TERM

Following is the full text of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed:     Dear Mr. President,     As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate new appointment.         In that connection, you will recall that, upon my reappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the time, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably convenient and consistent with an orderly transition. Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to assume office.         I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a particularly challenging period for it, for the financial system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever success we have had.         Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those involved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring to that effort a combination of sound and independent professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan considerations.         May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder of your own term in office during which you have done so much to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the American people.     Faithfully yours,     Paul A Volcker  Reuter &#3;
