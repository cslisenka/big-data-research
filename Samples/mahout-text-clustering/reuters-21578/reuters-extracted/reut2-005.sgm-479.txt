U.K. BANKING HEAD RESUMES ATTACK ON CITY PREDATORS

The Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, repeated his criticism of City predators, describing them as "thoroughly irresponsible."     "I have been concerned when predators have sought to use a minority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managed company and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomes daily expected," he said in a speech to the Industrial Society.     "Such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsible exercise of shareholder power, and an abuse of the arrangements we have for the protection of shareholders' interests," he said.     Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a speech last week, when he attacked the practice of "putting a company into play."     This is when predators use a minority shareholding to force a company's management into action which will raise the company's share price. The predator then withdraws, taking substantial profits.     In today's speech, Leigh-Pemberton said it was hard to find the right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherence to a free market philosophy.  REUTER &#3;
