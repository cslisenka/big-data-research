HYDRO-QUEBEC IN HEARINGS FOR U.S. POWER EXPORTS

Hydro-Quebec, the provincially-owned utility, said it is appearing this week before the National Energy Board to defend its application to export about five billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the New England states.     The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in 1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebec utility said hearings are normally held on major contracts up to two years after the deal is signed.     Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billion dlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convince the board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.     Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have said they are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and New Brunswick utilities said they are objecting because Hydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going to the New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is also concerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export markets.     Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several provinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a power agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec utility's export contracts.     Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes to contracts in the past but has always left the agreements essentially intact.     He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether it believed the board would call for substantial changes to the agreement with New England.     He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last two or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.     Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export contracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed amounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.  Reuter &#3;
