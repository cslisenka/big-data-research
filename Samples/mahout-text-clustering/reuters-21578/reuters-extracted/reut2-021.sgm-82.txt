REXON <REXN.O> TO BUY BACK STOCK

Rexon Inc said its board authorized management to buy back up to 15 mln dlrs worth of the company's common shares because the company believes that the stock is an attractive investment at this time.     The stock would be used to offset the potentially dilutive effects of options exercises and of other shares which might be issued in the future, Rexon said.  Reuter &#3;
