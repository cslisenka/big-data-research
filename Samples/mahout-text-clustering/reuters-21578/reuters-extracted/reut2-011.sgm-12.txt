REGULATORS TO CONSIDER CBT EVENING SESSION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said that on April 15 it will consider the Chicago Board of Trade's proposal to establish night trading.     The Chicago exchange hopes to begin night trading at the end of the month. The proposed trading session -- which would be the first in the United States -- would extend from 1700 to 2100 local time (2300 to 0300 GMT).     CFTC also said that on April 22 it will consider the Philadelphia Board of Trade's application to trade futures on the Australian dollar and the New York Cotton Exchange's application to trade the five-year U.S. Treasury Index.
