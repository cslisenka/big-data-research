NORANDA <NOR> COPPER MINE BLAZE KILLS ONE

One miner has died and 44 miners remain trapped a half mile underground in a fire at a Noranda Inc copper mine, officials said.     Noranda said 26 miners had made it to a lunch room, where they had air and water, but 18 others were unaccounted for.     Two rescue teams were searching for the missing men.     Noranda spokesman Lionel Gleeton said miner Ange-Marie Kenney, in his 30s, died when he was caught in thick smoke about 1,000 feet from the lunch room. His body was found by rescuers.  Reuter &#3;
