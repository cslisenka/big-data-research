CANADA'S WILSON SAYS G-7 DISCUSSED LIQUIDITY

Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline.     "There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada, the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany, France and Italy)," he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting.     "There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system. Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer, interest rates have been dropping," Wilson said.     "The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets. I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries," Wilson said.     "This has been going on during the course of yesterday, through the evening and this morning and this will continue," he said.     "What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economies...looks good," Wilson said.  Reuter &#3;
