ROYAL <RRCO> SEEKS NAME CHANGE, SHARE BOOST

Royal Resources Inc said it is calling a special shareholder meeting for April 21 seeking approval of a name change and an increase in its authorized common shares.     Stockholders will be asked to change the company's name to Royal Gold Inc to better reflect the company's goal to become a gold company.  Royal defines a gold company as one having more than 100,000 ounces of gold production a year.     In other action, shareholders will be asked to approve an increase in authorized common stock to 20 mln from 15 mln shares. The shares are expected to be used for future acquisition of gold properties, it said.     Previously, Royal said it agreed to sell its oil and gas properties to Victoria Exploration N.L. of Perth, Australia for 3.65 mln dlrs.  The company's holders also will be asked to approve the transaction.  Reuter &#3;
