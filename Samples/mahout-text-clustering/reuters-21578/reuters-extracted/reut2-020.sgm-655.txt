REAGAN SCRUBS RECEPTION TO KEEP EYE ON MARKET

President Reagan cancelled a reception for Republican presidential candidates on Tuesday in an apparent effort to make room in his schedule for a meeting on stock market developments.     "The postponement is being made to accomodate the president's schedule today. The president continues to follow developments in the stock market," the White House said.     There was speculation that Reagan would meet with Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan at 4 PM EDT, which was when the reception was to have taken place.
