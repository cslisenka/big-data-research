ROCHESTER GAS <RGS> SEES FURTHER NUCLEAR DELAYS

Rochester Gas and Electric Co said it now estimates Unit Two of the Nine Mile nuclear power plant will not start commercial operation until 1988's first quarter.     The utility said this estimate is based on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's advisory to the plant's operator, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp <NMK>, a more through demonstration of the main steam isolation valve's acceptablility will be needed before the plant's power ascension program can proceed.     Rochester Gas disclosed the further delay in the operation of Nine Mile Unit Two in the preliminary prospectus describing its proposed offering of 300,000 preferred shares, par value 100 dlrs.     A spokesman said Niagara Mohawk had been projecting commercial operation of the plant in September, adding this projection was scheduled for review upon completion of the main steam isolation valve testing program which company officials still expect next week.     In the past, Niagara Mohawk has put the cost of delays in Nine Mile Unit Two at two mln dlrs per day.     Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in the nuclear power plant, while Rochester Gas owns 14 pct.     In a statement released today, Rochester Gas said the NRC, based on progress of the valve testing program, had advised Niagra Mohawk a more through demonstration of the acceptability of the valve's and their ability to meet regulations and technical specifications will be required before the power ascension program can proceed.     The Niagara Mohawk spokesman said the utility would have not immediate response to the Rochester Gas statement.  Reuter &#3;
