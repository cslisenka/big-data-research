DIAMOND <DIA> SPINOFF TO HAVE 60/40 DEBT/EQUITY

Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp told Reuters that the new company will have a debt to equity ratio of 60/40.     Hemminghaus said cash flow between 80 and 120 mln dlrs per year will reverse the ratio to 40/60 within two years.     He said the spinoff, to be called Diamond Shamrock R and M Inc, will probably occur just before the annual meeting of  Diamond Shamrock Corp. The annual meeting is scheduled for April 30 in Dallas, he said. Hemminghaus was in San Antonio for the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.     An effort by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens to take over Diamond Shamrock was a reason behind the company's decision to spinoff, although a spinoff may have occurred anyway, Hemminghaus said.     He said that investment advisors told the company Pickens' offer was inadequate and suggested the company split up into a pure exploration and production upstream operation and a pure play downstream refining and marketing company.     He said he is hopes to raise 400 mln dlrs in financing for the new company.     Hemminghaus said 65 to 75 pct of the new company's earnings will come from wholesale refining, 20 to 30 pct will come from the retail sale of gasoline and other items at gasoline convenience store locations, and five to 10 pct from natural gas liquids and storage and marketing.     "Growth will be defined in building retail volumes, jobber volumes and refining capacity after that," Hemminghaus told Reuters. He said the new company will have a capital spending budget of 35 to 55 mln dlrs a year.      Reuter &#3;
