S/P WITHDRAWS RATINGS ON CAESARS WORLD <CAW>

Standard and Poor's Corp said it withdrew the ratings on Caesars World Inc and unit Caesars World Finance Corp.     The action affects 230.8 mln dlrs of debt.     Withdrawn were Caesars World's BB senior debt and B-plus subordinated debt and the unit's B-plus subordinated debt.     S and P said these issues are expected to be refinanced when Caesars World implements a recapitalization plan. The agency assigned a B-plus rating to Caesars World's proposed 330 mln dlr issue of seven-year senior notes and a B-minus grade to its 330 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 1999.     Standard and Poor's noted that the recapitalization plan of Caesars World calls for the payment of a 26.25 dlr per share dividend totaling 929.3 mln dlrs.     The recapitalization plan will be financed by the seven-year note and 12-year debenture issues, 300 mln dlrs in bank and other debt, and by cash on hand, S and P noted.     The agency said that Caesars World's debt will rise to 1.1 billion dlrs from about 319.2 mln on April 30 and the firm will have stockholders' deficit of 508.8 mln dlrs. S and P said it does not expect a meaningful reduction of debt for the next several years.  Reuter &#3;
