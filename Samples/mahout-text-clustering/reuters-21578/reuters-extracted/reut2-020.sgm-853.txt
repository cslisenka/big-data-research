BANK OF JAPAN BUYS 200 BILLION YEN OF BILLS

The Bank of Japan reassured a nervous money market after the sharp fall in Tokyo stock prices yesterday by conducting a 200 billion yen commercial bill purchase operation, money traders said.     The central bank injected funds through three-month repurchase agreements which mature on January 11 and bear interest of 3.9375 pct, identical to this morning's rates on three-month commercial bills.     The operation was done partly to roll over 300 billion yen in commercial bills maturing this morning. Money market sources project a 260 billion yen surplus today.     In the bond market, the Bank of Japan offered to buy around 50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds, encouraging an already firm tone in bond prices, dealers said.     The Bank of Japan was trying to reassure market participants that it was ready to supply funds whenever the market needed them, especially after Tuesday's plunge in Tokyo stock prices, securities house traders said.     The widely held market belief that interest rates were heading higher was a major cause of the recent tumble in bond market prices and one reason behind the stock market plunge, they said.
