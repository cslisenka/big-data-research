AMEX CHANGED STOP/STOP LIMIT ORDER POLICY

The American Stock Exchange said effective March Three it started allowing specialists to accept both stop orders and stop limit orders in which the stop price and limit price are not identical.     Previously, specialists were only allowed to accept stop order and stop limit orders in which the stop and limit prices were identical.  The Amex said floor officials may still prohibit specialists from accepting stop and stop limit orders that would be detrimental to the market.  Reuter &#3;
