GM <GM>  CUTTING SALARIED MERIT RAISES

General Motors Corp told employees it was reducing the funds available for merit-raises for 109,000 salaried workers.     GM, which has been taking wide-ranging steps to cut costs, said in a letter it cut the amount available for raises to 3.5 pct of the payroll from 5.5 pct in 1986.     The letter also said raises will be given in one annual lump-sum payment from April rather than being folded into salaries and thus increasing the base for benefit payments.  Reuter &#3;
