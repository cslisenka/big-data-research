NASD TO DELIST LOS ANGELES SECURITIES <LASG>

Los Angeles Securities Group said the National Association of Securities Dealers intends to delist its securities effective tomorrow because the NASD believes that market-making sales of the company's securities by its Los Angeles Securities brokerage subsidiary are not being made under an effective registration statement.     The company said it must demonstrate compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, which requiresd the registration statement, to avoid delisting.  It said it believes that the NASD action is without merit and that an effective registation stateement is in place.     Los Angeles Securities said it is asking the NASD to stay the delisting pending a review of the matter, consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a potential hearing on the merits.  It said pending resolution of the matter, it has ceased making a market in its own securities.     The NASD has instituted similar actions against other holding companies for broker/dealers that are quoted on its NASDAQ system.  Reuter &#3;
