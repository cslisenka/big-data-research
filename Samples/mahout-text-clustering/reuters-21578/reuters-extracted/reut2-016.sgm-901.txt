ZIMBABWE UNITY TALKS OFF, MUGABE SAYS

Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said he suspended key talks to unite his ruling ZANU-PF party and opposition PF-ZAPU party.     "I am sorry to say we have been deadlocked for too long on the question of unity, and the central committee of my party has recently decided that the talks be discontinued for they are serving no purpose," he said in a nationwide radio-and-television address.     The collapse of the unity talks, widely expected to have heralded creation of a socialist, one-party state, was a major setback for the government, diplomats said.  Reuter &#3;
