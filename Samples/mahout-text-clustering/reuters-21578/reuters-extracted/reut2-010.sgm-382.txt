BONN WELCOMES PUBLIC SECTOR WAGE SETTLEMENT

The government welcomed a wage settlement for public sector workers which was agreed late last night as a fair compromise for both sides, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told reporters.     The wage settlement gives 2.3 mln workers in federal, state and local governments a 3.4 pct wage increase for 1987, retroactive from January 1.     The public sector union OeTV had originally sought a six pct increase, while the government's initial offer was 2.7 pct.  REUTER &#3;
