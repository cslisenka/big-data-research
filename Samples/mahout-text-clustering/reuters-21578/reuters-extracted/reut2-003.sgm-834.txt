<BANK OF CHINA> TO JOIN VISA NETWORK

<Visa International>, owned by a consortium of banks, said Bank of China has agreed to become a Visa member in May, and a Visa card will be issued for use in China and around the world.     No international credit cards are currently issued in China.     Visa said plans are underway to install electronic terminals at Visa-accepting merchants in China later this year to authorize the growing number of credit card transactions by tourists and minimize operating risks.     Visa said it plans to extend its worldwide telecommunications network to China this year through a satellite link, allowing authorization requests to be forwarded to card issuers around the world.     Over 1,000 merchants in China now honor the Visa card and the number is expected to double by the end of next year, it said, and card transactions in China are expected to rise 50 pct from the current 130 mln dlrs a year during 1987.     Visa International said it is already designing the Visa card that Bank of China will issue.  Reuter &#3;
