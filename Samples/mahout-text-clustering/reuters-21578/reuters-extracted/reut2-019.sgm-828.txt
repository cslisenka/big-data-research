S/P DOWNGRADES AMERICAN HEALTHCARE <AHI> NOTES

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded American Healthcare Management Inc's subordinated notes to D from B, affecting 80 mln dlrs of securities.     S and P said that this for-profit operator of 34 actue-care hospitals missed its semi-annual interest payment on the debt.     The rating agency said the failure to renegotiate terms on bank obligations was the key to this default. That is because payments on the notes are prohibited until default under terms of senior obligations is remedied.  Reuter &#3;
