WORLD BANK PRESIDENT OPPOSES DEBT FORGIVENESS

World Bank President Barber Conable said he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because the proposal, if adopted, would lead to a cutoff in lending to the indebted countries.     "I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an environment in which no more money will go into development and a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to instability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.     A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.     "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous improvement in policies, of wise use of money in short, rather than trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.     Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."     Baker has said the best way to reduce the developing countries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates through reformed domestic policies and increased commercial bank lending.  Reuter &#3;
