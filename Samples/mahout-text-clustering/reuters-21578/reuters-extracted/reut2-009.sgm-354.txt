UNISYS <UIS> INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS

Unisys Corp introduced two new mainframe computers, new workstations, and other products.     The company said the V510 and V530 large-scale computers offer up to a four-fold increase in performance over existing V series.     Customer deliveries of the new models, aimed at business, government and financial markets, are planned for the fourth quarter of 1987 and the first quarter of 1988.     Base price of the V510 system is 950,000 dlrs and the V530 system is based priced at 1,775,000 dlrs, the company said.     Speaking at a press conference, Joseph Kroger, Unisys vice chairman, said the new product introductions are the first concrete examples of the increased resources of the merged Burroughs and Sperry.     He said the company had exceeded its goal of cutting costs by 150 mln dlrs in the first year after the merger, and reduced debt by nearly two billion dlrs, more than the originally expected 1.5 billion dlrs.     In addition to the mainframes, Unisys introduced an addition to its B25 family of desktop computer systems. The new system, the B38, will make greater use of its Intel Corp <INTC> microprocessor using available software.     The B38 is available for immediate delivery with a base configuration price of 8,375 dlrs.     The company also introduced new software products, interconnect capabilities, and a laser printer.
