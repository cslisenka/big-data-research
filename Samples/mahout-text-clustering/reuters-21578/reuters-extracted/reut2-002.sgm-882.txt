EGYPT TO RECEIVE 115 MLN DLR CASH GRANT

The United States said it was transferring 115 mln dlrs in aid to Egypt as a cash grant to help boost its ailing economy.     The funds are part of 815 mln dlrs in economic aid voted by Congress for 1987.     State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley stressed that the transfer was not unexpected, and told reporters "We simply want to point out our continued support for Egypt's reform and the efforts they are taking to reform the economy and create economic growth."
