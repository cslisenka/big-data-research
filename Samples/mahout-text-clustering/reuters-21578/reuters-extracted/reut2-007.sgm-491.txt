SENATORS SAY JUSTICE MISHANDLED TENNECO PROBE

The Justice Department mishandled an investigation into alleged fraud on Navy contracts by a unit of Tenneco Inc <TGT>, two senior senators charged.     The charges, made jointly by Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were based on a report by subcommittee staffs of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Joint Economic Committee on the Justice Department investigation.     "Serious mistakes were made at every stage of the Newport News investigation and much time wasted during lengthy periods of inactivity," the report said.     The Tenneco unit, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co, asked the Navy in 1976 for reimbursement of 894 mln dlrs in cost overruns in the construction of 14 nuclear-powered ships. The Navy settled the claims for 208 mln dlrs in 1978 and then refered the case to the Justice Department for investigation of possible fraud.     In 1983, the Justice Department decided to end the investigation without prosecuting Newport News.          Reuter &#3;
