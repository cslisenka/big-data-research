TRANSAMERICAN CHALLENGES COASTAL <CGP> STANDING

<TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> said it denies that Coastal Corp has standing to file a plan or reorganization for TransAmerican in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.     In an earlier statement, TransAmerican said, Coastal claimed its rights to file a reorganization planhad been affirmed by the court. "Coastal claims they have standing, but no final determinatioon has been made," TransAmerican said.     The company said various Coastal subsidiaries have made unsecured claims totaling 700,000 dlrs which are disputed by Transamerican.     The company said it has a claim against Coastal's Coastal States Trading Inc subsidiary for almost three mln dlrs. This claim resulted by a breach of contract in the trading company's failure to provide crude oil to the Good Hope Refinery in Louisiana which was operated by TransAmerican's predecessor company, <GHR Energy Inc>.
