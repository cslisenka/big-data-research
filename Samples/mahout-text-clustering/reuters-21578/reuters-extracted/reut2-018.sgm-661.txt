BRAZIL UNION PROPOSES GENERAL STRIKE FOR JULY 15

The national executive of Brazil's most militant trade union group has proposed a general strike for July 15 in protest at the government's austerity program.     A spokeswoman for the Workers' Confederation, CUT, told Reuters today that the proposal would be discussed within the trade union movement.     On Friday the government of President Jose Sarney introduced austerity measures to try to combat the country's high inflation rate, currently running at more than 1,000 pct a year.     The new plan scrapped a "trigger" mechanism which had guaranteed regular pay rises in line with high inflation.     Trade unions say real wages are dropping by about a third.  Reuter &#3;
