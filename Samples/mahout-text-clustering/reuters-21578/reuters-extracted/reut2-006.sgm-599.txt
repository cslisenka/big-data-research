UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY

U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.     The controversial study, which has not yet been released by the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD sources in Paris said last month.     Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday, suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.     The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.     The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for the years 1979 through 1981.     Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.     Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.     An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations. U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect recent changes in farm programs worldwide.     The officials said the study may be released in May.  Reuter &#3;
