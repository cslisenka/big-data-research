WRIGHT SAYS A GAS TAX AN OPTION TO CUT DEFICIT

House Speaker Jim Wright said a gasoline tax is one option to finding a way to reduce the deficit, but told reporters in response to a question he will not try to dictate a solution to the debt problem.     Wright has made suggestions for raising taxes about 20 billion dlrs as part of a budget plan to reduce the deficit. Tax proposals are being given consideration by members of the House Budget Committee, but the details of any tax increase would be made by the tax writing House ways and Means Committee.
