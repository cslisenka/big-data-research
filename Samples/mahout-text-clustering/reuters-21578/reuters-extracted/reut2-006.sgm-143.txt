COMINCO <CLT> IN TRAIL, KIMBERLEY NEGOTIATIONS

Cominco Ltd said it was in the second round of two-week-old negotiations with about 3,200 unionized workers at its Trail and Kimberley, British Columbia zinc-lead operations.     The existing two-year contracts expire April 30. The workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America.     A Cominco spokesman, queried by Reuters, declined to comment on whether the company was confident of reaching a new agreement before April 30, but said the union had not yet taken a strike vote.     The contracts cover 2,600 production workers at Trail and Kimberley and 600 office and technical staff at the two operations.     Trail produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead in 1986. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter.
