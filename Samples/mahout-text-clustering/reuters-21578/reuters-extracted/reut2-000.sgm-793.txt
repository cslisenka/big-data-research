WHITE HOUSE WITHDRAWS GATES NOMINATION AS CIA CHIEF

The White House announced it was withdrawing the controversial nomination of Robert Gates as CIA director at Gates's request and has not yet decided on a replacement.     Withdrawal of the Gates nomination was announced by new White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, who said President Reagan had several names under consideration to replace Gates but had made no decision on that score.     Baker said Gates had sent Reagan a letter today requesting his name be withdrawn from nomination to succeed the ailing and resigned William Casey and that Reagan had "accepted with great regret."
