VIETNAM PARLIAMENT FIRES PRIME MINISTER, PRESIDENT

Vietnam's parliament sacked Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, but the choice of their successors indicated the influence of the old guard may not be over, diplomatic sources said.     Dong, prime minister for 32 years, left in fading health at the age of 81. He is a popular hero of wars against France and the United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.     Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo member Pham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed the Viet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.     Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter of economic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for the less important presidency.     That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat who ranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong was more in tune with the national economic and political changes being pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upper hand in the all-important politburo in December.     Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars against France and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His political stance had recently softened, the sources said.  REUTER &#3;
