DELORS REPORTS STRONG OBJECTIONS TO EC CASH PLAN

European Community Commission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan for changes to Community financing.     In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves pruning their own spending.     Others called for major spending cut in the EC's controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional and social development.     The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a second two-year term.     Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the EC should be based on their gross national product instead of on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of sharing the financial burden.     He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about increased payments, he had told some heads of government the Community needs more money.     Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to reform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for over two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to ask for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those farmers."     He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government - Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when you are asking for a common market in goods and services?"     EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine internal market in industrial products and services.     Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes.  REUTER &#3;
