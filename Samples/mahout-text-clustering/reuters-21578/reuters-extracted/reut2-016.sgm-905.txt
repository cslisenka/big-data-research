FORMER BALDWIN-UNITED CHIEF SETTLES SEC CHARGE

The former chief executive officer of Baldwin-United Corp, now known as PHLCorp <PHX>, agreed to settle charges stemming from misleading financial statements the company is accused of making before it collapsed in 1983.     Under the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, former Baldwin-United President Morley Thompson agreed to an order issued by the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, Ohio, barring him from committing further securities law violations.     Thompson did not admit or deny the charges.     Although Thompson was the last of several defendants to settle charges brought by the SEC on September 26, 1985 in connection with the Baldwin-United case, the agency said it is continuing to investigate other matters related to the company and may bring charges against other people.     Baldwin-United, a Cincinnati-based diversified financial services holding company, went bankrupt in September 1983. It changed its name last November to PHLCorp.     The SEC said Thompson violated reporting and anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws in late 1982 by issuing misleading press releases.     Baldwin-United, which has already settled SEC charges brought against it, made "false statements concerning the financing for two corporate acquisitions," the SEC said.     The statements indicated that the company had available cash for the takeovers while it was actually facing a "serious cash flow crisis," it said.     The company was also accused of filing false and misleading financial statements with the SEC.   Reuter &#3;
