LLOYDS, ROYAL CANADA TRIM HONG KONG OPERATIONS

Lloyds Bank Plc <LLOY.LON> and the Royal Bank of Canada <RY.TOR> are winding down the primary side of their capital markets activities in Hong Kong, the chief executives of the two banks said.     "We are withdrawing from the primary market in Asia," said Barry Maddams, Lloyds' general manager here. "It is basically unprofitable."     The bank's treasury and capital markets activites, previously conducted separately at the commercial bank branch and its merchant banking arm Lloyds Asia Ltd, are now being consolidated within the commercial bank, he said.     Maddams said the bank has not decided whether it will surrender Lloyds Asia's registration as a deposit taking company (DTC), but it will keep another DTC registration for LBI Finance (HK) Ltd as a booking vehicle. He did not say how many jobs will be affected.     Royal Canada has surrendered the licence of its DTC unit Orion Royal Pacific Ltd, though it still has some assets and uses the name, said Vincent Fan, bank chief executive here.     He said 16 jobs will be lost due to the phase-out of merchant banking, while syndication and other banking activities will be continued by the commercial bank.  REUTER &#3;
