REAGAN SAID OPEN TO DEAL ON 1988 U.S. TAX RISE

President Reagan is willing to compromise with Democrats in Congress on a plan to raise new federal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform the budget process, White House Budget Chief James Miller said.     "If the Democrats want to insist that the president say whatever is agreed to is a tax increase, then they'd better just forget it because he's not going to do that," Miller said in an interview with Reuters.     "But there are a lot of revenues other than those the president proposed (in his January budget plan), I think, that we might look seriously at," he added.     The Reagan budget, which has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, envisages raising 22 billion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package of government assets and new fees on certain federal services.     President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any tax increase voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year, arguing that cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce the huge federal deficit.     The deficit, which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year, is expected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year and would fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budget blueprint recently approved by Congress.     The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan contains about 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes in the government's budgetary year beginning October 1.     The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to be raised, leaving it to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to fill in the details later this year.     Miller appeared to be signaling that the president might consider some sort of tax increase despite his frequently stated rejection of the concept.     However, Miller declined to say which new revenue sources might be acceptable to the president.     "I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set out options) which might suggest that we have one thing or another in mind," the White House budget chief said.     He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions of certain moves, such as raising excise taxes on beer, cigarettes or telephone service, or raising corporate or personal income tax rates.     "I think that those in Congress who think it will be a simple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxes are underestimating what they would be getting themselves into," he said. "What they don't really realize is that the political opposition they are going to feel to excise taxes is going to be a lot hotter tahn the political opposition to user fees, in certain ways, or asset sales," he continued.     "But there are a lot of other things and revenue issues in government that probably ought to be addressed," he said.     Before agreeing to a revenue package, the president would insist on reform of the budget process, Miller said.     "The president is not going to take a sucker punch. He's not going to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we can't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact will be delivered," he emphasized.     "We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a contract, so that if the president agrees to something, he can depend on its coming through."     After returning to the United States from the economic summit in Venice earlier this month, President Reagan revived an earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform, calling for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the power -- called a "line-item veto" -- to block individual items in congressional spending bills.     At the Venice summit, U.S. trading partners called on Washington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global trade imbalances.         Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S. trading partners "have to have faith and trust in the ability of the United tates to deal with its problems."     He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year "is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit. I don't think we can end the deficit overnight... I think we've got to have a gradual reduction over a period of several years."  Miller is in Beaver Creek attending the sixth annual World Forum, a gathering of current and former government officials and business representatives discussing world economic and political issues.
