U.S. ATTORNEY INDICTED IN INSIDER SCHEME

An attorney was named today in a 24-count federal indictment alleging he initiated an insider trading scheme which allowed friends and relatives to make nearly 1.5 mln dlrs in illegal profits on non-public knowledge of a corporate restructuring.     Israel G. Grossman, 34, who had been a pension specialist for the New York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen and Kamin, allegedly stole information from the firm involving the recapitalization of Colt Industries Inc <COT> last July.     Grossman, who was arrested February 17, allegedly enabled three individuals whom he alerted to purchase 1,006 colt call options for 33,938 dlrs.     July 21, the day after the Colt recapitalization was announced, its common stock rose almost 27 points. The options increased to a value of about 1.5 mln dlrs, according to Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who announced the indictment today.     Grossman is charged with 12 counts of mail fraid and 12 counts of securities fraud. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 120 years in jail and fined a total of six mln dlrs.     Grossman resigned from the law firm following his arrest. He is scheduled to enter a plea March 26.  Reuter &#3;
