MCKESSON <MCK> SELLS CULINARY ACADEMY

McKesson Corp said it sold the California Culinary Academy of San Francisco to an investor group headed by the academy's president, Fred Seymour, for undisclosed terms.     The 400-student academy was founded nine years ago and was acquired in 1982 by McKesson. The company said it sold it because it no longer fits with its business direction.  Reuter &#3;
