FRANCE'S CRH CANCELS TWO BILLION FRANC TAP ISSUE

French mortgage refinancing agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire (CRH) has cancelled today's auction of between one and two billion francs worth of tap stock, the Bank of France said.     In a statement the agency cited "exceptional circumstances" on the bond market which resulted in a low level of applications.     Today's issue would have been a new tranche of the agency's March 1987 8.50 pct 12 year issue. At its last auction in May the CRH sold 2.02 billion francs worth of the stock at a top accepted price of 91.10 pct giving an average 9.79 pct yield.  REUTER &#3;
