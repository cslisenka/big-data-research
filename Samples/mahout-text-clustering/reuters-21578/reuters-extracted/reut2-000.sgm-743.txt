U.S. TROOPS GET COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger ordered an increase in cost-of-living allowances for many U.S. military personnel abroad because of the decreased value of the dollar against foreign currencies, the Pentagon said.     The allowances are expected to rise between 10 and 20 per cent in many areas beginning this month, the Pentagon said..     Weinberger also is providing for some family members of financially-pressed troops to fly home from West Germany, Japan, Italy and Spain on military transports if they desire.     He said in a statement to the military that the cost-of-living increases "will help keep your overseas purchasing power close to your stateside counterparts."  REUTER &#3;
