STRIKES HALT PLANES AND TRAINS IN SPAIN

Spain's air and rail transport was at a virtual standstill as airline ground staff and railway workers joined university students and health workers in strikes against the Socialist government.     Railway workers and staff at the state airlines Iberia and Aviaco want pay rises of seven to eight pct but the government has imposed a ceiling of five pct to control inflation.     Under a government decree ordering the strikers to maintain minimum services Iberia was due to operate 32 of its 330 flights and Aviaco 10 out of 82. Flights to and from Spain by other airlines were not affected.     Student demonstrations in several cities last night led to clashes with riot police in Madrid, Cadiz and Saragossa.     The state railway network operated some commuter services but passengers who tried to use the few sleeper trains running last night were met by angry pickets and found compartments without light or heating.
