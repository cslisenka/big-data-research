FORMER REPUBLIC EMPLOYEES GET ESOP FUNDS

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said checks totaling 33 mln dlrs are being mailed to 2,500 of its members who formerly worked for Republic Airlines and are now employed by Northwest Airlines (NWA).     The payoffs result from a trust agreement and employee stock ownership plan negotiated in early 1984 by the union to protect Republic workers when the airline was in financial difficulty, the union said.     Republic has since merged with Northwest Airlines.  Reuter &#3;
