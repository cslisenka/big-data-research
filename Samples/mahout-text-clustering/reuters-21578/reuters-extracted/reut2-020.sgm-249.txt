MEXICO CLOSES BORDER TO SOME U.S. FRUIT

Mexico has decided to close its border to imports of fresh fruit from San Diego and Orange Counties in California, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Mexico City said in a field report.     The report, dated October 14, said the border closing became effective September 25 and also includes the surrounding 70-mile area of the two counties.     While the ban applies specifically to Orange County fruits that are hosts of the Mediterranean fruit fly and San Diego County fruits that are hosts of the Oriental fruit fly, the Mexican Government will stop all fresh fruit shipments from the counties until proof of non-infestation is provided, the report said.
