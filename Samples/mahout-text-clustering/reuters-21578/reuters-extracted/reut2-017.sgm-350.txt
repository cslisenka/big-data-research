MANITOBA SEEDINGS PROGRESS WELL IN DRY WEATHER

The Manitoba Agriculture Department weekly crop report said no measurable precipitation was reported across the province in the past week, allowing small grain seedings to progress rapidly across the south, with field preparation under way in the northern growing regions.     Small grains should be seeded across the Province in one to two weeks, assuming weather remains dry.     Planting progress was most advanced in the southeast, with 30 pct of the spring wheat acres and 40 pct of the barley acres seeded. Cereals plantings were well under way in the south central part of the province, with seedings spotty so far in the southwest.     Summer fallow acres should be in line with the latest Statistics Canada projections, the report said.  Reuter &#3;
