NYFE TO MOVE TO N.Y. COTTON EXCHANGE

The New York Futures Exchange will move its trading operations to the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, NYFE president Lewis J. Horowitz and Cotton Exchange president Joseph O'Neill announced.     NYFE will become an affiliate of the Cotton Exchange through a licensing agreement while remaining a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange.     NYFE's trading floor and floor support staff will move to the Cotton Exchange, which is located in the Commodity Exchange Center at Four World Trade Center. The move should be completed by the first quarter of next year, a Cotton Exchange spokeswoman said.     The plan was approved today by the board of the Cotton Exchange and previously by the New York Stock Exchange.     The move will offer traders from both exchanges access to each other's contracts. Cotton exchange members will have trading rights to NYFE's New York Stock Exchange composite index futures and options contracts and its Commodity Research Bureau Index contract.     NYFE members will have the opportunity to trade the Cotton Exchange's U.S. dollar index futures and options contracts and its European Currency Unit futures contract. They will not have trading rights to cotton and frozen concentrated orange juice futures.  Reuter &#3;
