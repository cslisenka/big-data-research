JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE ROW

Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the U.S. imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said at the weekend.     Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement that Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.     However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington on Friday.     In March President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honor a July 1986 pact to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the U.S. and to open its home market to U.S. goods.     Fukukawa said the U.S. had not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact. He saod the U.S had not given detailed reasons of why it planned tariffs.  Reuter &#3;
