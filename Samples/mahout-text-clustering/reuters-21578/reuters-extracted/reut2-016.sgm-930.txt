ARMY REBELS OCCUPY MANILA HQ

A truckload of heavily-armed rebel soldiers forced their way into Philippine army headquarters and freed several men held prisoner in the camp since a January revolt, military sources said.     The sources told Reuters an estimated 100 rebels were occupying the headquarters building at Fort Bonifacio and forces loyal to President Aquino had surrounded the building urging them to surrender.     An independent radio station reported gunfire at the camp.  REUTER &#3;
