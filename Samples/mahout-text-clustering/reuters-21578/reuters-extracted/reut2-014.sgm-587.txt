N.Y. FCOJ FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER

Frozen concentrated orange juice futures closed 2.60 to 0.80 cents higher, though the market failed to hold early gains of as much as 4.40 cents in the July delivery. Estimated volume was 1,000 contracts.     May was up 1.70 cents at 132.90 cents, off a high of 133.50 cents. July was up 2.60 cents at 131.70 cents.     Speculative short covering early in the session pushed the market up, after locals succeeded in triggering stops over 132.00 cents in the May. The trade was an early buyer as well but turned seller at the top, taking profits and knocking prices off the early highs.     The afternoon session was quiet and prices remained steady. Traders said spot May now roughly reflects the ex-dock price of Brazilian juice.  Reuter &#3;
