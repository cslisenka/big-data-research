WORLD ENERGY OFFICIAL OPPOSES U.S OIL IMPORT FEE

Helga Steeg, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said a U.S. oil import fee would disrupt world markets and could prompt trade retaliation against the United States.     She told the U.S. chapter of the World Energy Conference  she believed "an oil import fee would be difficult to operate, would generate unacceptable economic costs and that it would gravely hamper and distort international trade in energy."     Steeg also said it would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by imposing a discriminatory tariff, permitting retaliation by oil exporting countries.     Steeg praised President Reagan's opposition to a tax, which would be aimed at helping the U.S. oil industry.  Reuter &#3;
