NASD PROPOSES EQUAL SHARE VOTES WITH VARIATIONS

The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc said its board of governors has proposed adoption of uniform rules by major U.S. stock markets which would emphasize equal shareholder voting rights but allow for legitimate variations.     The NASD said its proposal would eliminate differences in stockholder voting standards as a competitive factor between markets. It called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt such a rule applying to all markets if each equity market is unwilling to voluntarily adopt a uniform rule under the commission's guidence.     "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to" voluntarily adopt a uniform rule such as it is proposing, NASD President Gordon S. Macklin said in a letter to SEC Chairman John S.R. Shad.     The NASD said its view is based on the association's study of the issue and from information developed at the SEC's recently concluded hearings on the subject.     The current discussion of the one share-one vote issue was triggered by the New York Stock Exchange's application to the SEC for permission to abandon the standard with respect to companies listed on the NYSE, the NASD noted.     It called for limiting variations of equal voting rights to situations involving complete disclosure such as -      (1) shares in a registerd public offering where all facts connected with the company's capital structure are clearly spelled out in the prospectus and -      (2) shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied by detailed proxy material.     The NASD said the uniform rule should be written to disallow the issuance of dual classes of shares where those with superior voting rights are not resalable.  Reuter &#3;
