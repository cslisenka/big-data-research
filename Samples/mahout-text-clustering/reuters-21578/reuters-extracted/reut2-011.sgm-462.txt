IRISH BUDGET CUTS DEFICIT TARGET

Ireland's new minority government presented a tough budget that trimmed public spending across the board. The current budget deficit target was set at 1.20 billion punts, which is 6.9 pct of GNP. This compared with the 1986 figure of 1.395 billion punts, 8.5 pct of GNP.     Finance Minister Ray MacSharry told parliament "Conditions are extremely difficult and there is no room at all for soft options." The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement was 1.85 billion punts, 10.7 pct of GNP, compared with 2.145 billion punts or 13.0 pct of GNP last year.     MacSharry announced a wage freeze for Ireland's 187,000 civil servants and said all new civil service jobs had to be approved by him. Mortgage interest relief was cut, some housing grants axed and social welfare and health costs trimmed. Income tax and excise duties were left unchanged.     Eager to stop the outflow of funds from Ireland, he said "We must do more to encourage non-residents, and especially expatriates, to invest in the Irish economy."     Without giving details, he also said Ireland wished to provide the right conditions and a favourable taxation climate for developing the international fnnancial services sector.  REUTER &#3;
