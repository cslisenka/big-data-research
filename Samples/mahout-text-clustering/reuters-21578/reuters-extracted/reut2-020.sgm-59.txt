EAST, WEST APPROVE NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY PROJECT

East and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.     Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.     Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany, and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statement said.     Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday, known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.     The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries.     Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.     Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.     While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium, an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water, according to experts.
