GULF ARAB FINANCE MINISTERS TO MEET IN ABU DHABI

Economy and finance ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states will meet in Abu Dhabi on March 17 and 18 to discuss their unified economic agreement, officials said.     The semi-official United Arab Emirates' (UAE) daily al-Ittihad said they would discuss two clauses, effective from March 1, opening up wholesale trade and industrial loans in GCC states to all GCC citizens.     The six states - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - agreed in 1981 to integrate their economies and eliminate barriers to the movement of people and goods.  REUTER &#3;
