NISSAN MEXICANA TO TAKE OVER CAR ENGINE EXPORTS

<Nissan Mexicana SA de CV>, owned 96.4 pct by Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSAN.T> and the rest by Marubeni Corp <MART.T>, will supply all engines for manual transmission "Sentra" cars produced by Nissan Motor's wholly-owned subsidiary <Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp USA> (NMMC), a Nissan spokeswoman said.     Nissan's shift to Mexican production from Japan is due to improved quality there and the yen's rise against the dollar.     From July 1987, all car engines for NMMC will be supplied by Nissan Mexicana. As a start, Nissan Mexicana shipped a total of 17,000 car engines to NMMC last summer, the spokeswoman said.     NMMC in Smyrna, Tennessee, which has produced Sentras since March 1985, made 65,000 cars.     NMMC will more than double Sentra production to 140,000 this year including 80,000 to 90,000 manuals, she said.  REUTER &#3;
