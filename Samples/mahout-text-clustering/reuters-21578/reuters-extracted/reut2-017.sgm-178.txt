USDA SEEKING COMMENTS ON 1988 FARM PROGRAMS

The U.S. Agriculture Department is seeking comments on common provisions of the 1988 wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice programs.     It said many program provisions are common to all the commodity programs and decisions made in regard to one will likely apply to other program crops.     It asked for specific comments on the percentage reduction for acreage limitation requirements under the wheat program, the loan and purchase level, and whether a marketing loan, the inventory reduction program and related provisions should be implemented.     The percentage acreage reduction of between 20 and 30 pct must be announced no later than June 1, 1987 for wheat, it said.  Reuter &#3;
