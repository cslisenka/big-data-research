ITALY'S SME IN VENTURE TALKS WITH FOREIGN FIRMS

State-owned food company <Societa Meridionale Finanziaria Spa - SME> is discussing possible share exchanges and joint ventures with Unilever PLC-NV <UN.A> and Swiss firm Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z>, a SME parent company spokesman said.     A spokesman for state holding company <Istituto Per La Ricostruzioni Industriale - IRI>, which controls SME, said the talks were centered on "possible swaps of minority stakes and production collaboration."     He declined to say if SME was close to an accord with one or both of the foreign firms.  Reuter &#3;
