EC EXPERTS TO STUDY POSSIBLE ACTION AGAINST JAPAN

European Community trade experts will meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss possible EC action against Japan over trade, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.     She told Parliament the officials would examine ideas put forward by the U.K. Last weekend. "Trade matters and trade initiatives have to be taken by the Community," Thatcher said.     She said the experts would focus "on more effective action against the dumping of components (by Japan), possible unbinding of tariffs on certain products (to allow each EC country to set their own tariffs) ... And measures which might be necessary to avoid diversion if the United States acts against Japan."  REUTER &#3;
