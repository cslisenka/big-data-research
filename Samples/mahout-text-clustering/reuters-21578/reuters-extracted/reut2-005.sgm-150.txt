BRITAIN, JAPAN AGREE ON FLIGHTS OVER SIBERIA

Britain and Japan agreed to operate 12 flights a week over Siberia each other including eight non-stop services from May 31, officials of the Transport Ministry said.     The officials said both countries reached agreement at their civil aviation talks here enabling British airline companies to begin regular air service on the trans-Siberian route between London and Tokyo. Japan Air Lines Co <JAPN.T> (JAL) already operates one flight on that route.     Ministry sources said <British Airways> and <British Caledonian Air Lines> were expected to share the six British flights each week over Siberia.     They said Britain, currently operating seven weekly Japan-Britain flights, all via Anchorage, Alaska, will be allowed to operate a total of 10 flights a week from May 31.     Under the agreement, the British side can also operate flights from Tokyo to Seoul instead of Singapore.     Japanese airway companies will be able to increase the number of weekly flights to nine from May 31 from eight currently, comprising six trans-Siberian flights, including four non-stop flights, and three flights via Anchorage.
