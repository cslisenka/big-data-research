California Credit Card Trust 1987-B, a unit of BankAmerica Corp's Bank of America subsidiary, is offering 300 mln dlrs of certificates backed by credit card receivables, said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.     The certificates were given an 8.20 pct coupon and were priced at 99.89 to yield 8.21 pct, or 85 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The debt has an average life of 1.8 years, matures in 1992, and is rated Aaa by Moody's.     Bank of America Capital Markets co-managed the deal, which is the second this year of California Credit Card. In February it sold 400 mln dlrs of credit card debt via First Boston.  Reuter &#3;
