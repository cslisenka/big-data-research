GENERAL MOTORS (GM) CANADA TO CLOSE TRUCK CENTRE

General Motors of Canada Ltd said it will close its Montreal truck centre August 31, due to low sales volume, putting most of the centre's 131 employees out of work.     "The sales volume at the centre has been insufficient to support the operation," the company said in a statement.     "With the recently announced joint venture with Volvo to supply the heavy-duty truck market, customer requirements for the GM line of light and medium duty trucks will be better satisfied by GM dealers located throughout Quebec," the company said.     General Motors Canada said it will provide 52 weeks of layoff benefits for most employees and up to 104 weeks for some senior employees.  Reuter &#3;
