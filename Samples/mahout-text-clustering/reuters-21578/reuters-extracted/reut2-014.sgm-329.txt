CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES MOSTLY HIGHER AT MIDSESSION

CBT soybean futures held gains of three to 6-1/2 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade, with new crop supported by local house buying.     Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basis values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support futures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in the weekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.     The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish, which could limit declines when South American sales begin to pick-up later this month, they added.     However, some traders said new crop prices above 5.00 dlrs a bushel could encourage some farmers to plant more soybean acres than they originally planned.  Reuter &#3;
