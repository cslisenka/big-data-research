U.S./USSR TRADE IMBALANCE CITED AS PROBLEM

U.S. purchases of Soviet products must increase before the Soviet Union will buy more U.S. goods, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.     "American exports (to the Soviet Union) depend on Soviet exports to the United States," said Albert Melknikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.     "One should not forget that it is impossible only to buy from the United States. We must be able to sell our products to the United States as well," he said in an interview.     The Soviet trade deficit with the United States totalled around two billion dlrs in 1985, Melnikov said.  Reuter &#3;
