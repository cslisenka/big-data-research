AMERICAN MOTORS <AMO> TO RESUME LABOR TALKS

American Motors Corp said it is willing to resume negotiations with the United Auto Workers as requested by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson.     Negotiations began on January 21 on a contract for American Motors to build its new ZJ sports Jeep and to assemble Chrysler Corp's <C> Omni and Horizon cars at its Wisconsin plant.      The Chrysler cars are being phased out of production at the company's Belvidere, Ill. plant to make room for another car line to be built there.     "While we are willing to follow the governor's lead in making a final effort to reach an agreement, it must be recognized that for the negotiations to be successful, the local unions must honor their 1985 commitments," American Motors president Joseph Cappy said.
