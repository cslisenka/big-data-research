CONSOLIDATED OIL <CGS> WARRANTS PRICE UNCHANGED

Consolidated Oil and Gas Inc said the exercise price of its Oil Indexed Common Stock Purchase Warrants Series 1900 <CGS.WS.P> will remain three dlrs a share for the six month period July one to December 31.     The warrant exercise price is based on the average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil reported for the trading month of May. For the month, the average price was less than 20 dlrs per barrel, the first index point above which there would be a change in the exercise price of the warrants.  Reuter &#3;
