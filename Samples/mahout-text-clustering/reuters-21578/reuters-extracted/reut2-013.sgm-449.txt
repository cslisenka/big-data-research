DASSAULT SUSPENDS EGYPTIAN DELIVERIES, SAY SOURCES

Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation <AVMD.PA> has suspended deliveries of its Mirage fighter jets to Egypt because of payment delays on planes already delivered, aircraft industry sources said. A Dassault spokesman could neither confirm nor deny the suspension.     The sources said the last six of 20 fighters ordered by Cairo in 1983 were being held back, although the contract is expected to be completed in the near future. Deliveries started last year. They said the decision, taken in consultation with the French government, would pressure Cairo to speed up payments, delayed because of Egypt's foreign currency shortage.  REUTER &#3;
