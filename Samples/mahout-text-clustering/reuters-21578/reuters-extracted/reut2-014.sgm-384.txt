U.S. LIVESTOCK STRESSED BY WEATHER--USDA/NOAA

Snow and freezing temperatures stressed livestock in the eastern half of the United States in the week ended April 5, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In a summary of its weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said most Nebraska and Kansas livestock are fair as calf losses from the storm during the week were variable.     Calving and lambing continued.     Freezing temperatures slowed pasture growth in most areas, the agency said.  Reuter &#3;
