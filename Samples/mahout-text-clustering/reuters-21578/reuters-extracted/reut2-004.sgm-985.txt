CHRYSLER <C> BOOSTS PRICE ON FIFTH AVENUE CAR

Chrysler Corp's Chrysler Motors unit said it increase the price of its Chrysler Fifth Avenue  luxury sedan by 300 dlrs to 15,966 dlrs.     The higher price applies to cars produced by Chrysler at the American Motors Corp's <AMO> Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant, where Chrysler shares production with American Motors. Shipments of Chrysler cars from Kenosha began March nine.     Chrysler in the past year transferred production of the Fifth Avenue and two other car models to Kenosha from its St. Louis Number Two facility. A Chrysler spokesman said the price increase will cover the cost of moving the production line.     The spokesman said the higher price will apply only to the Fifth Avenue. Prices of the other two Chrysler models--the Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Diplomat--made at Kenosha will remain unchanged.     Chrysler moved production of the three large rear-wheel-drive cars to Kenosha in order to build stretch minivans at the St. Louis facility.     The spokesman said the first stretch minivan will roll off the line later this month.  Reuter &#3;
