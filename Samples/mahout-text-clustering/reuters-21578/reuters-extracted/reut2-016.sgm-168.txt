SOME JAPAN OIL FIRMS MAY STOP TRADING WITH TEXACO

Japanese oil traders and refiners are considering whether to suspend further business with Texaco Inc <TX>, which yesterday filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code, industry sources told Reuters.     Texaco, the third biggest U.S. Oil company, said it filed to protect itself from creditors while it fights a legal battle with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the purchase of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY> in 1984.     Many Japanese trading houses decided to stop dealing with Texaco several months ago as rumours it was about to file for bankruptcy spread through the market, the sources said.     "We haven't dealt with them for six months," said one Japanese trader.     Some Japanese trading houses with offices in the U.S. May ask for letters of credit if they decide to continue trading with Texaco, oil sources said.     They said Texaco, which said its bankrupcty protection measure will not affect the majority of its businesses, may find industry reaction stronger than anticipated.     "Texaco tried to buy substantial volumes of gasoline on the U.S. Gulf on Friday but no one offered to them," one trading house source said.     One U.S. Major is reviewing its relationship with Texaco, and an international oil trading company, while continuing limited transactions with Texaco, will send its lawyers to meet with the company tonight in New York, oil sources said.     But one Japanese oil company, which holds several joint venture oil exploration interests with Texaco, said business would continue as usual pending the outcome of the dispute, a company spokesman said.
