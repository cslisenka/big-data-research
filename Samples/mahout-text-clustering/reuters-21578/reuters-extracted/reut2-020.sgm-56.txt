SAMSUNG BOND GOES CONVERTIBLE BUT NO SHARE DEMAND

The first convertible bond issued by a South Korean firm overseas -- by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <SAMS.SE> -- became eligible for conversion but there was no demand for shares as the government still bans direct share ownership by foreigners, a Samsung official said.     "There was no demand from holders, so the lead managers made no approach to us to issue shares," the official said.     The five pct bond, co-lead managed by S.G. Warburg and Goldman Sachs Co, raised 20 mln dlrs when issued in 1985. The only other Korean convertible bonds were issued by Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd <DAEW.SE> and <Yukong Ltd>, both in 1986.
