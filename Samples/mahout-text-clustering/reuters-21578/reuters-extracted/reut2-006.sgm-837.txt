EIGHT KILLED IN DJIBOUTI BLAST

Eight people were killed and some 30 injured in a blast in a crowded cafe in the Red Sea port of Djibouti, a spokesman for the African country's main newspaper La Nation said.     Reached by telephone from Paris, he said the blast in one of the city's most popular cafes appeared to have been caused by a bomb.     He said the death toll had been given by Djibouti's Interior Minister whom he quoted as speaking of "a criminal act."  Reuter &#3;
