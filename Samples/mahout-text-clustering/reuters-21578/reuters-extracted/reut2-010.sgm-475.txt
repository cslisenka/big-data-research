REAGAN VETOES HIGHWAY BILL 

President Reagan vetoed an 87.5 billion dlrs highway and mass transit bill calling it a budget buster.     The bill, which also contains a provision allowing states to raise highway speed limits, now goes back to Congress where the White House faces an uphill battle to sustain the veto.     Reagan in a message to Congress said he had an alternative proposal that would authorize 66 billion dlrs over five years, the same levels as in the Senate-passed version of the bill.     He said he recognized the states were rapidly running out of highway funds and the legislation needed to make funds available for the 1987 construction season. He said was no reason why Congress could not send a new bill that he could sign before the spring construction season was any further along. Reagan supports raising the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on rural interstate highways.  Reuter &#3;
