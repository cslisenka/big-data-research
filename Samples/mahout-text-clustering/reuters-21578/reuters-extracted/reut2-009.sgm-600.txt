S/P MAY UPGRADE WAINOCO OIL <WOL>

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may upgrade Wainoco Oil Corp's 25 mln dlrs of C-rated subordinated debentures due 1998.     S and P cited the company's proposed offering of two mln units of common stock and warrants, which would raise 25 mln to 30 mln dlrs that would be used to retire bank debt.     The offering would also result in a significant strengthening of the company's capital structure, S and P pointed out. However, the agency said it would also consider depressed industry conditions and Wainoco's ability to operate in that environment. Its implied senior debt rating is CCC.  Reuter &#3;
