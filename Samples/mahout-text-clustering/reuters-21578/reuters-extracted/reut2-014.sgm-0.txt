JOHANNESBURG GOLD SHARES CLOSE MIXED TO FIRMER

Gold share prices closed mixed to slightly firmer in quiet and cautious trading, showing little reaction to a retreat in the bullion price back to below 420 dlrs and a firmer financial rand, dealers said.     Heavyweight Vaal Reefs ended eight rand higher at 398 rand but Grootvlei eased 40 cents at 16.60 rand, while mining financials had Gold Fields up a rand at 63 rand despite weaker quarterly results. Other minings were firm but platinums eased.     Industrials also closed mixed to firmer, the index once again hitting a new high of 1757 from Friday's 1753 finish. The overall index also hit a new high of 2188 versus 2179 on Friday.  REUTER &#3;
