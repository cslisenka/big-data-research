KANEB ENERGY <KEP> MAY OMIT FUTURE PAYOUTS

Kaneb Energy Partners Ltd said it may be forced to omit or lower future quarterly cash distributions because of a contract dispute with two major customers and the continued slump in oil and gas prices.     The partnership said, however, that it will pay a regular quarterly distribution of 60 cts a unit on April 15 to holders of record March 31.  Reuter &#3;
