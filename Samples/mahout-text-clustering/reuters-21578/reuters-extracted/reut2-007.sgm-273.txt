BOBBIE BROOKS <BBKS> IN RIGHTS PLAN

Bobbie Brooks Inc said its board approved a defensive common stock purchase rights plan.     Under the plan, shareholders will receive one common shares purchase right March 31 on each outstanding share of record on that date.     Each right entitles shareholders to buy one share of common stock at an exercise price of 4.50 dlrs. The rights are exercisable only if a person acquires 20 pct or more of the company's common stock.     Bobbie Brooks said the rights are not being distributed in response to any specific takeover effort.  Reuter &#3;
