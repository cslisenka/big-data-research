CREDIT SUISSE FREEZES ACCOUNTS IN INSIDER PROBE

Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z> has been ordered to freeze accounts thought to have been involved in a U.S. Insider trading scandal, a Justice Ministry spokesman said.     Joerg Kistler said the accounts belonged to two individuals and three companies, including Nahum Vaskevitch, former head of the London office of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER.N>.     The accounts were blocked under a treaty on legal assistance between the United States and Switzerland aimed at facilitating criminal investigations which might otherwise remain hidden because of Swiss banking secrecy.     The order prohibits transactions on the accounts for an initial period of 30 days, after an emergency request from the United States arrived last Friday.     The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which supervises stock market trading, alleged this month that Vaskevitch and an Israeli associate, Daniel Sofer, were behind an insider trading ring which netted profits of four mln dlrs.     The order freezes accounts owned by Vaskevitch and Sofer as well as those of the companies <Plenmeer Ltd> and <Meda Establishment>, Kistler said. He declined to name the third company, since it was not clear what role it played.     A spokesman for the bank said he was aware of the order. "Now we have to find out what is on the accounts," he said. He declined to give further details.     The SEC alleged in a New York court last week that Sofer transferred 1.9 million dollars from a U.S. Bank account of the company Plenmeer to an account at Credit Suisse.  REUTER &#3;
