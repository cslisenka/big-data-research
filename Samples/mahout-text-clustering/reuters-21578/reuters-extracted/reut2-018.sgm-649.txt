COMPUTER DEPOT <CDPT.O> TO CEASE OPERATIONS

Computer Depot Inc said it will cease operations and liquidate its assets.     The decision results from the termination of the company's line of credit by its asset-based lender and demand by the lender for immediate payment of all amounts due, it said.     Computer Depot said it will stop trading in its shares. Upon liquidation of the company, no accounts are expected to be available for distribution to shareholders after payments to creditors, it said.     In December 1985, Computer Depot, which sold personal computer systems and software, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Its plan of reorganization was approved in December 1986.     The company said that yesterday, after demand by its lender, it agreed to voluntarily surrender its inventory, accounts receivable and other collateral.     Operations are dependent upon financing and efforts to obtain financing, including potential buyers and merger candidates, have been unsuccessful, it said. Computer Depot said the company will eventually be liquidated.     Computer Depot reported a loss of 591,000 dlrs for its second fiscal quarter ended May 2, 1987, after showing a profit of 237,000 dlrs for its first quarter, which included the Christmas selling season.     The company previously reported that sales and margins after January had been below expectations, due to uncertainty in the in the retail market following recent product announcements by International Business Machines <IBM>.     Computer Depot auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co, qualified its recent financial statements citing several risks in the  company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Reuter &#3;
