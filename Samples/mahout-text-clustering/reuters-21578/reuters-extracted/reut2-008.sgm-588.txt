BOLIVIAN MINERS, GOVERNMENT CONTINUE STRIKE TALKS

Union leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol and government representatives will resume talks tomorrow in an effort to end a six-day strike over pay, a spokesman for the miners said.     A labour ministry spokesman said the talks, which began today, were suspended when labour minister Alfredo Franco left to attend a session of Congress also attended by visiting West German President Richard von Weizsaecker.     But mining minister Jaime Villalobos told reporters an agreement in principle on the rehabilitation of Comibol had been reached. He did not elaborate.  REUTER &#3;
