SHARE PRICES NEAR DAY'S LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION

Equities steadied near the day's lows at midsession after a hesistant start mainly due to lack of interest in quiet trading conditions.     Dealers said most of the trading appeared to be inter-professional, highlighting the market's cautious approach in the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latest opinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that the Conservatives will win the next general election, but the uncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettling factor.     At 1141 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 10.6 down at 1.979.0.     In a poll conducted for television programme TV-AM showed the Conservative Party 13 points ahead of the Oppsition Labour Party. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today, which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the Conservative party a lead of six points over Labour.     Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan, although less pronounced, provides a further note of caution, dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said it will help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate foreign membership.     The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despite gains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges further underlined market nervousness.     ICI fell a penny at 1,334, Glaxo 8p at 1,480, Beecham 12p at 521, BPB 10p to 660 and P and O 3p to 617. Wellcome shed 23p to 397 on profittaking after adverse press comment on the side effects of its "Retrovir" aids drug, dealers said. London International, makers of condoms, gained 14p at 302 in contrast.     Among few other gains Jaguar rose 12p to 587 mainly on U.S demand, dealers said, Unilever added 8p at 2,578, Plessey 2p to 243, as did Reuter at 701p.     In lower oils BP shed 13p at 907p after news yesterday Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell lost 10p at 1,223.     Banks mostly showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503 as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 4p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds was one penny higher at 488.     Extel further declined today, losing 28p to 462 in the wake of news yesterday British Printing and Communications Corp and its associates said they would not be making a bid for the company.     In mixed insurances Sun Life gained 7p at 1,085, Prudential Corp rose a penny  at 833 while Royal declined 4p to 945 as did Sun Alliance at 828.     The market now awaits Wall Street's opening, which is expected mixed to higher, for further direction. At 1151 GMT the FTSE 100 share index was eight points down at 1,981.0, lifted by some selected bargain-hunting after touching 1978.7 earlier.  REUTER &#3;
