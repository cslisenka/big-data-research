PAINEWEBBER <PWJ> BROKER INDICTED IN SCHEME

A former broker at PaineWebber Inc was charged by a federal grand jury with involvement in a 700,000 dlr money-laundering scheme, according to indictment papers.     Gary Eder, 41, a former vice-president at PaineWebber, was charged with conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records in the two-count indictment.     According to the indictment, Eder produced more brokerage commissions than any other broker at PaineWebber, and was its most highly-paid broker between 1982-86.     Eder is charged with conspiring with unnamed supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of Currency Transaction Reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Federal law requires that reports be filed with the IRS for any single cash transaction in one day of more than 10,000 dlrs.     Asked about the charges, a Painewebber spokeswoman said the company had not seen the indictment and had no comment. She said Eder was suspended January 22 and resigned from the firm on february 17.     David Spears, the federal prosecutor in charge of the case, said Eder received cash from individual customers in amounts ranging up to 70,000 dlrs at a time but avoided filing reports by depositing the cash into the customers' accounts in amounts just under 10,000 dlrs on several different days.     If convicted, Eder could receive a maximum jail term of ten years and 260,000 dlrs in fines.      Reuter &#3;
