PUBLICKER <PUL> AUDITORS' OPINION UNQUALIFIED

Publicker Industries Inc said its 1986 financial statements will receive an unqualified opinion by the company's auditors, Authur Andersen and Co.     The company said the qualified opinion on its 1985 financial statements will be changed to an unqualified opinion. The 1985 opinion had been qualified due to the uncertainty of the ultimate recoverability of the amount at which Publicker's United Kingdom beverage division's assets are carried.     The company said it has been in the process of substantially reducing its inventory of Scotch Whisky and currently intends to complete the reduction by the end of 1987.  Reuter &#3;
