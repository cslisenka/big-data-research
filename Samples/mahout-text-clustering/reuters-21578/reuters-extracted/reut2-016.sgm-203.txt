SAUNDERS DENIES "PAPER SHREDDING" ALLEGATIONS

Former Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> chairman Ernest Saunders dismissed allegations he ordered the shredding of documents in the early stages of a U.K. Investigation as "completely untrue," the Press Association news agency reported. The allegations were made by his former personal assistant Margaret McGrath, in a statement to the High Court on Friday.     Saunders' reply was read out by his lawyer at the start of the fourth day of a hearing, on an application by Saunders and U.S. Lawyer Thomas Ward for the discharge of "asset-freezing" orders obtained by Guinness on March 18.     McGrath alleged that among the documents destroyed were papers from the files on the <Distillers Co Plc> bid, as well as diaries, correspondence and an address book.     The temporary orders froze property owned by the two men valued about 5.2 mln stg, the sum paid by Guinness into a Jersey bank last May during the Distillers takeover.     They are also contesting orders requiring them to disclose the whereabouts of the money and hand it back to Guinness lawyers.  REUTER &#3;
