OGDEN CORP <OG> SETS SALE OF DEBENTURES

Ogden Corp said it has concluded the sale outside the United States through <Salomon Bros International Inc> and <Allen and Co Inc> of 85 mln dlrs of its six pct convertible subordinated debentures maturing in 2002.     The company said the debentures are convertible into Ogden common stock at 79.75 dlrs per share without giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split distributable on July three.     A portion of the proceeds will be used to redeem the 50 mln dlrs of outstanding senior subordinated debt which currently bears interest at a rate of about eight pct, the company said.         The balance of the proceeds is expected to be used in the financing of projects and general corporate purposes, the company said.     Ogden also said the potential conversion of the debentures will not adversely affect its current earnings and cash flow expectations.     The debentures have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. or to a citizen of resident of the U.S., the company said.
