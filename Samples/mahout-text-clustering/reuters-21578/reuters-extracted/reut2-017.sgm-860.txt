SECURITY PACIFIC <SPC> ADDS 500 MLN TO RESERVE

Security Pacific Corp said it intends to add 500 mln dlrs to its provision for credit losses during the second quarter, a move that will result in a loss for the period of about 175 mln dlrs.     The company added, however, that it now expects to post a profit for the full year of about 150 mln dlrs.     Security Pacific said the reserve is specifically related to its loans to the developing world.     Security Pacific, which has assets of about 64 billion dlrs, reported 1986 net income of 385.9 mln dlrs. Last year it posted second quarter net income of 93.5 mln.     In making the announcement, Security Pacific said the extra 500 mln dlrs will raise its reserve for credit losses to about 1.3 billion dlrs, or 2.8 pct of total loans and leases outstanding.     It said the amount of reserves allocated to Lesser Developed Country (LDC) debt represents about one-third of the company's total LDC debt portfolio.  Reuter &#3;
