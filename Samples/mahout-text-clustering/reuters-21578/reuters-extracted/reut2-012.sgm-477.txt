UK MOVES DATE FORWARD ON FINANCIAL RECIPROCITY

Britain will arm itself earlier than hitherto planned with statutory powers to retaliate if decided necessary against Japanese banking and insurance companies, on grounds that similar U.K. Based financial institutions do not enjoy the same market access in Japan, government sources said.     The provisions being brought forward under the new Financial Services Act are reciprocity clauses 183 to 186. The powers will allow Britain to revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance businesses, but will not affect licensed dealers in securities, the sources said. The news follows a cabinet meeting during which U.K./Japanese trade problems were discussed.     The government decided on the steps at its cabinet meeting this morning and aims to maintain pressure to ensure that U.K. Firms be allowed the same access to Japanese markets as Japanese banking and insurance firms enjoy in London's financial areas, government sources said.     One source said "we want reciprocity in those fields. And what we are saying is that, if not, then we can pull the plug and stop you from having an unfair and uncompetitive advantage."     The provisions being brought forward under the Financial Services Act will take effect after Easter, or in around 21 days, the sources said.  MORE &#3;
