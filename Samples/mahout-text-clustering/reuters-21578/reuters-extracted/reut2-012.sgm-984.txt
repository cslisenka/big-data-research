NORTHWEST AIRLINES ORDERS LONG-RANGE AIRBUS JET

U.S.-based Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc <NWA>, has ordered up to 20 of the European Airbus Industrie <AINP.PA> consortium's planned A340 long-range jets, with an option on a further 10 A330 medium-range jets, in a deal worth more than 2.5 billion dlrs, Airbus said in a statement.     The contract gives Airbus its first launch customer in the lucrative U.S. Market for its long-range jet programme.     Last month Airbus announced it had a total of 104 commitments from nine customers for the planes. A spokeswoman confirmed today's order was in addition to those commitments.     Airbus has been competing with McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> in the long-range jet market since the U.S. Group formally launched its MD-11 plane program at the end of 1986. McDonnell Douglas has won over 100 orders and options for the aircraft.     The Northwest order comes after the airline ordered 10 short-range A320 Airbus jets, with options on a further 90, last October, giving Airbus a foothold in the U.S. Market.     European governments, asked to fund 2.5 to three billion dlrs of the Airbus A330/340 programs, have said there may not be room in the world aircraft market for Airbus's jets.  Reuter &#3;
