DISTILLERS <DR> KNOWS NO REASON FOR STOCK MOVE

National Distillers and Chemical Corp said it was unable to explain a sharp rise in its stock.     National Distillers rose 3-1/8 to 63-3/4 in moderate trading of 84,000 shares. Texas investor Robert M. Bass recently filed a 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a stake of more than five pct.     John Salisbury, vice president and general counsel of National Distillers, said there were no new developments concerning Bass. Salisbury also said the company continues efforts to sell its liquor business and several potential buyers have inspected the properties.     Robert Reitzes, analyst at Mabon, Nugent and Co, said National Distillers's wine and liquor business combined might be sold for between 600 and 700 mln dlrs. The company completed sale of its Almaden wine business to Heublein Inc earlier this week but did not disclose any figures. Heublein is owned by Grand Metropolitan plc.     Reitzes said he reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock yesterday, calling it the biggest commodity chemical play in the industry. He said recently increased polyetylene prices appear to be holding.  Reuter &#3;
