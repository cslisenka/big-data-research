SHEARSON LEHMAN NO LONGER ADVISING KHOO

Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will no longer be working as financial advisers for financier Khoo Teck Puat, Shearson said in a statement.     Acting as Khoo's advisers, Shearson formulated a repayment proposal to the National Bank of Brunei Bhd (NBB). Brunei authorities closed the bank last November, alleging 90 pct of its loans of 1.3 billion Brunei dlrs had been extended, without documentation or guarantee, to firms controlled by Khoo's family and friends.     Sources close to Khoo said creditor banks and the NBB are still studying the proposal submitted in February.  REUTER &#3;
