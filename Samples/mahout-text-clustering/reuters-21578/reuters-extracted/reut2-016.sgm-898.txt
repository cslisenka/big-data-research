BRITISH AUTOMAKERS SEE U.S. 1987 SALES DOUBLING

British Automobile Manufacturers Association expects exports to the United States to more than double in 1987 to 56,595 units from 26,200 in 1986, association president G.W. Whitehead told reporters at the New York Auto Show.     "We feel this is the appropriate occasion to announce the return of British cars as an important force in the U.S. imported car market," said Whitehead, who is also president of Jaguar Plc's U.S. unit.     Whitehead said increased sales will result from intensified North American marketing by British automakers.  Reuter &#3;
