MOODY'S UPGRADES GE <GE> MORTGAGE INSURANCE UNIT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it upgraded to Aaa from Aa-1 the insurance rating of General Electric Mortgage Insurance Co of Ohio, a unit of General Electric Co.     Moody's said this reflected the strengthening of terms in a revised net worth agreement between GEMICO and its immediate parent, General Electric Credit Corp, whose long-term unsecured debt is also a top-flight Aaa.     However, the rating agency said the agreement does not benefit other GEMICO affiliates in California, Florida and North Carolina.  Reuter &#3;
