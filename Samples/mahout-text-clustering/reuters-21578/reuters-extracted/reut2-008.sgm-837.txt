CONTROL DATA <CDA> LAUNCHES NEW CYBER SYSTEM

Control Data Corp, the computer concern, is introducing its first department computer, the CYBER 180 Model 930, which will integrate a computer network starting with desktop computers through its mainframe line to the supercomputer.     "For Control DATA, it signals our intent to compete in our marketplace more completely than ever before," said Gil Williams, Control Data's vice president of Computer Systems, one of six business units.     The large Minneapolis-based computer concern, hit hard after two years of huge losses, has said it anticipates a profitable year ahead. But Control's computer business has not been profitable since 1983.     Last year, the company lost 264.5 mln dlrs, including a fourth quarter restructuring charge of 139.9 mln dlrs and a one-time loss of 69 mln dlrs.     "We will use the 930 strategically not only to solidify and expand relationships with existing loyal customers...but also to create new sales opportunities for the corporation with businesses large and small," said Williams.
