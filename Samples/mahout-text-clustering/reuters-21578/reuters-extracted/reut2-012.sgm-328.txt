MOORE <MCL> TO AMEND RIGHTS OF PREFERENCE SHARES

Moore Corp Ltd said it proposed amendments to a special resolution seeking shareholder approval for authority to issue preference shares, so that the shares will be non-voting except in the event of dividend non-payment.     It said it proposed the amendments in response to shareholder concerns that under the existing resolution, voting rights could be attached to the preference shares that are disproportionate to common share voting rights.     Moore Corp said it has no immediate plans to issue preference shares under the proposed resolution.     The resolutions will be considered at the April 9 annual and special meeting, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
