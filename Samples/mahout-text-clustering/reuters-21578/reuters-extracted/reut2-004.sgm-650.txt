JAPAN CLARIFIES FUND MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS

The Finance Ministry has clarified regulations governing fund management, satisfying overseas critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn, ministry officials and Western diplomats said.     They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreign fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well.     A foreign investment management company will be permitted to employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another on standby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.     In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm is eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will take account of the amount of funds the parent company has under management, a ministry official said.     "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the criteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.     He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment management licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms, including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensed under the new law passed late last year.  REUTER &#3;
