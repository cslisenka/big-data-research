AUSTRALIA'S OPPOSITION PARTY GAINING POPULARITY

Australia's opposition coalition of Liberal and National parties has closed the ruling Labour party's three percentage point lead in the past month, a public opinion poll published today said.     The Morgan Gallup Poll showed both sides were level on 45.5 pct in a nation-wide poll of about 2,000 voters.     It also showed public support was growing for Andrew Peacock, who was dismissed as the opposition's foreign affairs spokesman two days ago, although the poll was conducted a week before he was removed.     The survey, published in the Bulletin magazine, said 49 pct of the voters wanted Peacock while only 18 pct supported opposition leader John Howard.     Peacock has said he may challenge Howard for the leadership before the next elections due before April, 1988.     Howard sacked Peacock as shadow foreign minister after accusing him of undermining the leadership during a telephone conversation with another party member.     The car-telephone conversation was picked up by an unidentified man using a radio scanner and published in the Melbourne Sun newspaper.  REUTER &#3;
