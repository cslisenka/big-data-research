NO MAJOR FARM POLICY CHANGES THIS YEAR - DOLE

There will be no significant changes in U.S. agricultural policy this year, said Senate Minority leader Robert Dole (R-Kan).     Speaking at the annual convention of National Grain and Feed Association, Dole said that while the current farm bill is not perfect, "I still believe it is a step in the right direction."     Dole said he would like to reduce the costs of the program but that expenditures will continue to be high until the U.S. becomes more aggressive in its export policy through either the broader use of the Export Enhancement Program or the implementation of a market loan for wheat and feed grains.     Commenting on whether the U.S. should offer the Soviet Union subsidized grain, Dole said, "If your going to trade with the Soviet Union you have to be competitive."     He said one way to get around the problem of making direct subsidies to the Soviets would be to implement a market loan, which he said would make U.S. commodity prices competitive.     Prospects for passage of mandatory production controls, specifically the Harkin-Gephardt mandatory bill, are not good, he said. "Mandatory has less support now than it did a year ago and it will have even less support when people understand it," he said.     If the House passes a pending 0/92 bill for 1987 winter wheat, the Senate will try to address 0/92 for a one year period, Dole added.  Reuter &#3;
