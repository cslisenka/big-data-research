SIEMENS WINS DANISH TELEPHONE SWITCHING ORDER

Siemens AG <SIEG.F> said it won a major order from Jydisk Telfon Aktieselskab (JTAG), Denmark's second largest telephone company, for its EWSD digital dialing system.     A Siemens statement gave no financial details. But it said the JTAG order, together with an order received in 1985 from the largest Danish telephone firm, Kjobenhavn Telefon Aktieselskab (KTAS), brought Siemens' order volume in Denmark to around 100 mln marks over the next 10 years.     The JTAG order is for at least 125,000 telephone connections with an option to double this amount later.     Siemens said the order meant that it, like Sweden's L.M. Ericsson <ERIC.ST>, now supply both of Denmark's largest telephone companies.     Together Siemens and Ericsson have 90 pct of the Danish long-distance dialing system market, it added.  REUTER &#3;
