CONT'L ILLINOIS WON'T COMMENT ON RESERVE RUMORS

A spokesman for Continental Illinois Corp said the bank will not comment on rumors that it will soon add to reserves to cover possible losses on loans to developing countries.     Rumors circulated on Wall Street today that Continental would soon join the long list of banks adding to reserves. Some analysts speculated that a decision would be announced after Continental's regularly scheduled board meeting, which will be held Monday. "Our board meets on the fourth Monday of every month, but their agenda is confidential," the spokesman said. He said "we will not comment on any rumors."  Reuter &#3;
