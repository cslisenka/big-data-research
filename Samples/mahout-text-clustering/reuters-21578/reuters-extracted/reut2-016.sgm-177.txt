ITALIAN BANKS TO SIGN ACCORD WITH SOVIET BANKS

Italian state-owned bank Banca Commerciale Italiana, BCI, said it and Mediocredito Centrale will sign a joint venture pact with Soviet central bank Gosbank and Vneshtorgbank, the foreign trade financial institution.     A BCI spokesman told Reuters the agreement involves the banks providing financial services and taking equity stakes in joint Soviet-Italian industrial ventures.     Under the agreement, the Italian banks will have a 50 pct interest in a new firm to be formed by the four institutions. The accord is expected to be signed today or tomorrow at a Venice conference on East West trade, the spokesman said.     The spokesman said the joint venture company will operate primarily in the corporate finance sector. Additional details about the firm's activities were not available, he said.     BCI is Italy's second largest bank, while Mediocredito provides medium-term export financing.  REUTER &#3;
