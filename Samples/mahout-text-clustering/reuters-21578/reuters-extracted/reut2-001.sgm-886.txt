MOST BOLIVIAN CENTRAL BANK EMPLOYEES RESIGN

about 1,000 bolivian central bank employees, more than 80 per cent of the workforce, accepted management terms to quit today, a union leader said.     "none of the employees who have decided to resign from the institution is prepared to work again in the bank, unless many of the economic and social conditions improve," bank workers leader mario galindas told reuters.     The centre-right government of president victor paz estenssoro had approved a restructuring plan which envisaged at least 600 redundancies, about half the bank's workforce, in line with its policy of streamlining the state sector.     Galindas said the bank needed at least 800 employees to keep up its present functions.     The bank agreed to pay a 5,000 dollar bonus to every employee who resigned, as well as the legal redundancy terms of three months salary plus one for every year worked.  Reuter &#3;
