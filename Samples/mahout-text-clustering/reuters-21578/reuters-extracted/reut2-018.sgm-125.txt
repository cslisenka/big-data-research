ITALIAN ECONOMISTS REGRET VOLCKER DECISION

Leading Italian economists said they regretted Paul Volcker's decision not to serve another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.     Luigi Spaventa, Professor of Economics at Rome University, told Reuters he thought the decision was a great loss to the world's financial markets.     "He (Volcker) was an element of reliability and stability around world financial markets, a man of great experience, balance and equilibrium," Spaventa said.     Spaventa said it was difficult to gauge immediately what Volcker's decision might mean for the dollar, but he noted that the markets seemed to like Volcker.      Mario Monti, Director of the Institute of Economics at Milan's Bocconi University, told Reuters that "whoever succeeds Volcker would face a formidable task because no central banker has ever given such credibility to monetary policy and fighting inflation."     Monti said Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated to take over from Volcker, was likely to pursue "a rigorous monetary policy to demonstrate to the markets that there will be no loss of credibility."     Officials at the Bank of Italy and the Italian Treasury had no comment on Volcker's decision.  REUTER &#3;
