S/P KEEPS BORG-WARNER ON CREDITWATCH

Standard and Poor's Corp said it is keeping Borg-Warner Corp's 400 mln dlrs of debt on creditwatch with negative implications.     Under review are the company's A-plus senior debt and A-1 commercial paper.     S and P cited an offer by a Merrill Lynch and Co-backed investment group's offer to acquire Borg-Warner for 3.76 billion dlrs.     The purchase would increase Borg-Warner's financial risk and impair its earnings and cash flow protection, resulting in a debt leverage rise to a very high level, S and P said.  Reuter &#3;
