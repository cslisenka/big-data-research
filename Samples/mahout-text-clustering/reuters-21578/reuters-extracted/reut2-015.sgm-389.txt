State-owned Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) has signed contracts with three U.S. Firms to supply equipment and services for its tenth and eleventh nuclear power plants, a KEPCO spokesman said.     Combustion Engineering Inc <CSP> will supply pressurised light-water reactors, General Electric Co <GE> will provide turbines and <Sargent and Lundy Engineers> will supply engineering and design services, he said.     Work on the two plants, at Yongkwang in the southwest of the country, is due to start around June 1988 and be completed in 1995 and 1996.     The firms will receive a total of 430 mln dlrs, or 11.5 pct of the construction cost of 3.74 billion dlrs.     The three suppliers were chosen from 13 bidders after tenders closed in April 1986.     South Korea operates six atomic stations, is building another three and has plans for about 20 by the year 2000.  REUTER &#3;
