SWISS WARY OF U.S.-BRITISH BANK SUPERVISION PACT

Markus Lusser, vice-president of the Swiss National Bank, said he was sceptical of the recent U.S.-British accord on joint bank supervision, fearing smaller countries could be forced to cooperate.     In a speech prepared for delivery to a meeting of West German savings banks, he said such an accord would cover the three most important financial centres of the world if extended to Japan as planned.     "Countries not prepared to cooperate with an agreement of the group of three could easily be put under pressure," Lusser said.     "It would be enough to forbid banks the right to make use of those financial markets or to place them under a special status," he added.     Banks which operate worldwide could scarcely afford to stay away from these centres and would place their national governments under pressure to conform.     Lusser added that he was opposed to the form, though not the content of the accord. Switzerland itself was not affected, since capital adequacy requirements here were already stricter than in Britain or the United States. But he feared such accords might be substituted for internationally negotiated pacts.  REUTER &#3;
