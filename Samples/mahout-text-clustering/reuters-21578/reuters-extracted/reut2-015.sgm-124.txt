DUTCH CHEMICAL FIRM DSM TO BE PRIVATISED

Dutch state-owned chemical firm NV DSM <DSMN.AS>, the former Dutch state mines, which today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next year.     DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists "We have done our homework. We're ready. It is up to the state now."     He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSM's assets in 1988 was not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in the hands of Parliament.     Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy declaration last autumn.     Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price, but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98 mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit.     "We ought to be able to match our German competitors on price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally has a lower ratio than the world's major exchanges, " he said.     The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.  Reuter &#3;
