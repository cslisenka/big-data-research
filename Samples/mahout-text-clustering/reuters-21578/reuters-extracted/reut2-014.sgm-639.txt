BRAZIL SETS UP SPECIAL DEBT COMMISSION

Brazil has set up a special debt commission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to be responsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollar foreign debt, officials said.     The principal negotiator on the commission, created by President Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister Ramiro Saraiva Guerreiro.     Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission by eight senior officials, including a representative of the National Security Council.     The creation of the commission is intended to underscore the Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is essentially political and that a political solution must be found to the problem.     On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.     Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are equally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.     Yesterday Funaro travelled to the U.S. for fresh debt negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia's suspension of interest payments.  Reuter &#3;
