NYSE TO SUSPEND AND DELIST WEDTECH <WDT> ISSUES

The New York Stock Exchange said it would suspend trading in Wedtech Corp's common stock, 13 pct convertible subordinated debentures due on June 15, 2004 and 14 pct senior subordinated notes, due August 15, 1996 before the opening of trading on June 16.     Following suspension, the exchange said an application will be made to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the issues.         The exchange said the action was taken in view of Wedtech's unsatisfactory financial condition which it said the company disclosed on April 23 and because it believed Wedtech was unable to transfer its listing to another securities martketplace.     The exchange said it may at any time suspend a security if it believes that continued dealings in the security on the exchange are not advisable.  Reuter &#3;
