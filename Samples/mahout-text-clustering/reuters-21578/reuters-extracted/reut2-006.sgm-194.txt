MACMILLAN BLOEDEL<MMBLF> RAISES NEWSPRINT PRICE

MacMillan Bloedel Ltd said it increased its current newsprint list price for customers in the United States by 30 U.S. dlrs a tonne, effective July 1, 1987.     Standard white 30 pound newsprint sold through sales unit Powell River-Alberni Sales Corp will increase to 600 U.S.dlrs a tonne from 570 U.S. dlrs a ton, MacMillan Bloedel said.     It also said a five pct temporary competitive allowance introduced on Dec 1, 1985, will be reduced to three pct, while a five pct contract performance incentive program introduced July 1, 1983 will remain in effect.     MacMillan Bloedel said customers who annually purchase 100 pct against their contract will receive the five pct discount under the contract performance incentive program plus the three pct discount under the temporary competitive allowance, against the new 600 U.S. dlr a tonne newsprint price.     The company said it is restoring margins on newsprint and groundwood printing papers so it can continue expanding and upgrading its pulp and paper facilities.  Reuter &#3;
