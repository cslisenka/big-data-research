CHINA MUST CUT DEMAND, CONTINUE REFORMS: ZHAO

China must cut excess demand and capital investment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits but will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in 1987, Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament.     Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People's Congress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cut its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986, serious imbalances remain.     Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, and demand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is too high. "(They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (and issue) excessive wage and bonus increases," he said.     Failure to cut this excess will "result in reduced accumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality," Zhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low per capita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.     China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption must match the available resources, he said.     Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986 because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost of foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income from customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.     Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw and semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and investment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.  Reuter &#3;
