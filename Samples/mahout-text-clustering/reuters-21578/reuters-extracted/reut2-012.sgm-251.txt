U.S. HOUSE BUDGET GROUP NEARS BUDGET AGREEMENT

The Democratic-controlled House Budget Committee neared approval, over Republican objections, of a trillion dlr budget plan for 1988.     Committee Chairman William Gray said he wanted approval later today of the Democratic-written document, which would produce a deficit of about 133 billion dlrs using Congressional Budget Office estimates.     However, Gray said using President Reagan's economic assumptions, the plan would show a deficit of 108 billion dlrs to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget law target. Republicans protested they had not seen the plan until today.  Reuter &#3;
