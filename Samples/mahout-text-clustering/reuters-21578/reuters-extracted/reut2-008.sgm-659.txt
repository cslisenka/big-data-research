SECOND PAKISTAN BOMBING KILLS 22

Afghan warplanes killed 22 people in a second bombing in as many days of a remote Pakistani village near the Afghan border, official Radio Pakistan said.     The radio said the six planes attacked Angur Adar in the South Waziristan area. Afghanistan has denied previous charges of bombing Pakistani territory.     Officials said the death toll from yesterday's Afghan bombing in Teri Mangal to the north had risen to at least 70 as more bodies were recovered. Fifty-one people were reported killed yesterday.
