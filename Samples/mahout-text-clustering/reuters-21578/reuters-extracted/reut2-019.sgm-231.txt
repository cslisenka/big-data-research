GTE <GTE> DEVELOPS METHOD FOR MAKING TRANSISTORS

GTE Corp scientists said they have discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistors by creating an entirely new electronic material.     The new method, they said, consists of simultaneously "growing" metal connections and silicon crystals together to form one, three dimensional device with connections penetrating the entire device.     Conventional transistors require many steps to make and have connections only on the surface.     GTE Laboratories created "an entirely new electronic material and device form, which may open up a spectrum of uses that cannot even be imagined at this time," said David Decker, vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories.     "Although still early in our research, we are obviously excited that we have found a significantly simpler and, we believe, cheaper way to produce an electronic device," he said.     Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combining and heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalum disilicide, so that the two grow together.     The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending througout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistor that should be superior to standard devics in high power applications, the scientists said.     They said that, because the connections extend vertically througout the new device, it has a much greater volume of active material than conventional surface-mounted connections.     Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages of their research on the device, but prototypes of the new device compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and show promise of superior performance.     He said the prototype device also proved to be particularly efficient in detecting light, which could open up new possibilities in solar energy conversion, the development of electronic cameras and greater efficiency in optical communication systems.
