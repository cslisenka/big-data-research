PAINEWEBBER ANALYST SEES RECORD AIRLINE PROFITS

PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> analyst John Pincavage says most airline stocks are undervalued in relation to record industry earnings expected in 1987.     Noting that the airlines as a group earned 85 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 compared with a loss of 625 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986, Pincavage sees an improvement of similar magnitude in the current quarter. He believes earnings for the group will total about one billion dlrs in the second quarter of 1987 compared with 250 mln dlrs in earnings in the second quarter of 1986. "We're shaping up for a record year in 1987," Pincavage told Reuters.     For the third quarter of 1987, Pincavage expects the group to earn about 1.5 billion dlrs compared with one billion dlrs in the same period of 1986.     Noting that the summer quarter is always a peak period, he says "at this point it's too soon to tell" about trends in the latter months of 1987. But he says for the group as a whole, fare discounting practices are not pressuring earnings like they were last year.     Pincavage has not changed any recommendations recently, maintaining buys on Texas Air Corp <TEX> NWA Inc <NWA> and AMR Corp <AMR> and rating most others attractive.  Reuter &#3;
