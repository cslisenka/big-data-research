WORKERS TO END 4-DAY STRIKE AT GENERAL MOTORS

United Auto Workers members voted overwhelmingly to ratify a settlement in a four-day strike against General Motors Corp's <GM> truck and bus complex here, a UAW official said.     Workers agreed to a settlement that provided for a 1.3 mln dlrs payment to workers by the No. 1 carmaker for an alleged violation of a 1984 contract and for the rehiring of about 20 workers who were idled when their jobs went to subcontractors.     Some 9,000 workers walked off their jobs at the bus and truck plant on Thursday.     Members of UAW Local 594 voted 1314 to 25 to accept the settlement.     Local president Donny Douglas said of the settlement, "We got compensation for everything that went out."     Workers alleged GM violated their contract by assigning work traditionally done by the union to outside companies. Local officials also said GM violated contract provisions on health and safety issues, work rules, seniority and job classifications.     The local also said that GM had violated contract language on work rules, seniority, job classification and health and safety issues.     A spokesman for GM's Truck and Bus Group said there would be no company comment on the settlement's details, but said GM was pleased that workers would be back on the job.  Reuter &#3;
