CARIBBEAN SELECT <CSEL> TO REDEEM WARRANTS

Caribbean Select Inc said it has elected to redeem on April 10 all its Class A warrants and all Class B warrants at 0.01 ct each.     At the same time, it said its board has decided to reduce the exercise price of the Class B warrants to 3.50 dlrs per common share from four dlrs to encourage the exercise of the warrants.  Each Class B warrant allows the purchase of one common share.     It said each Class A warrant is still exercisable into one common share at two dlrs each.  Reuter &#3;
