MYERS TO HEAD U.S. PARTY TO WORLD FOOD COUNCIL

Peter Myers, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture will head the U.S. delegation to the World Food Council's Thirteenth Ministerial in Peking, China June 8-11, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The discussions will center on four issues -- the global state of hunger and malnutrition and the impact of economic adjustment on food and hunger problems, the impact of international agricultural trade and related national policies on food and development, regional cooperation in food and agriculture among developing nations in the Southern hemisphere, and activities of multilateral assistance agencies aimed at reducing hunger.     The World Food Council is a 36-country United Nations body, which recommends how governments and international organizations can work together to alleviate world hunger.   Reuter &#3;
