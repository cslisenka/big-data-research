EXOVIR <XOVR> TO GET EUROPEAN PATENT

Exovir Inc said the European Patent Office notified it that its application covering combinations of nonionic surfactants and all forms of interferon has been approved and a patent will be issued in about six months.     Exovir is completing trials of a gel combining alpha interferon and nonoxynol-9, an antiviral surfactant, as a treatment for genital and oral herpes and genital warts. The gel was given a U.S. patent in 1985.     It said clinical tests will begin shortly to test whether the gel is effective in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus when used with a condom.
