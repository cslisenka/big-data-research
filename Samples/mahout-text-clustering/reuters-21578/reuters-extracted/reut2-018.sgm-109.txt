AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK SEEKS COFFEE COOPERATION

The African Development Bank (ADB) is seeking a broad-based cooperation agreement with the 25-member Inter African Coffee Organisation (IACO), based in Abidjan.     ADB secretary general Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference he hoped the bank's governors would approve such an agreement at the ADB annual general meeting next week in Cairo. The bank is seeking cooperative agreements with various international organisations including IACO, he said.     Dei-Anang said the ADB and IACO could cooperate on all fronts and an exchange of information would enable them to identify areas where the bank might help the coffee industry.  Reuter &#3;
