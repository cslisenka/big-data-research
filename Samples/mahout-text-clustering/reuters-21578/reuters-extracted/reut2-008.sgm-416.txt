CARLING O'KEEFE<CKB> JOINS STADIUM PROJECT

Carling O'Keefe Ltd, 50.1 pct owned by <Elders IXL Ltd>, said it agreed to contribute 5.0 mln Canadian dlrs towards the 245 mln dlr cost of building a dome stadium in Toronto.     The company also said its wholly owned Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League signed a 10 year lease, including an option for an additional five year term, to play its games at the dome stadium.     It did not disclose financial terms of the lease, but said it was a "very competitive lease" compared to an existing agreement with the Canadian National Exhibition stadium.     Carling O'Keefe said its 5.0 mln dlr contribution to Ontario Stadium Corp, which is undertaking construction and fundraising for the dome stadium, includes a 3.5 mln dlr donation and a 1.5 mln dlr payment for certain product and advertising rights.     Under the rights, the brewery will be able to use advertising space and feature its products at events that the company sponsors, Carling O'Keefe said.  Reuter &#3;
