HENLEY GROUP <HENG.O> DID NOT HIRE BEAR STEARNS

Henley Group said it has not hired Bear Stearns and Co in connection with Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX>, a Henley spokesman said.     Traders have said in the past two sessions that it seems Bear Stearns was restricted in both Santa Fe Southern and Henley, implying that Bear Stearns may be helping Henley examine the possibility of taking over Santa Fe.     "We don't have them looking into anything, including Santa Fe," a spokesman said, in response to questions from Reuters.     Bear Stearns has declined comment.     Traders said there was also speculation that Henley was a buyer of Santa Fe stock in the last two days.     Henley said it does not comment on whether it is buying or selling stock in a company.     Separately, Wall Street sources said the reports of Henley acquiring Santa Fe stock in recent sessions are untrue. Henley has told the securities and exchange commission that it bought about five pct of Santa Fe stock last year.     Santa Fe was up earlier by more than two points. It was trading at 42, up 1/8.
