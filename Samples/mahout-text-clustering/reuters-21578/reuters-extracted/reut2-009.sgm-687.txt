U.S. SENATE FARM PANEL MAKEUP STILL IN DOUBT

The composition of the Senate Agriculture Committee, in question since the death of Nebraskan Democratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky, remains in doubt.     Zorinsky's death earlier this month cut the Democrats' majority on the committee to 9-8.     Zorinsky's replacement, Republican David Karnes, has said he would like a seat on the panel, and Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) is said to have thrown his support behind Karnes, who would add a Midwestern vote to the panel.     But Karnes' appointment to the committee would require at least one Republican to step off the committee.     Aides to Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Pete Wilson (Calif.), whose spots on the panel were rumored to be in jeopardy, said their bosses were categorically opposed to being pushed off the committee.     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told Reuters he had rejected a suggestion that Democrats and Republicans each add one member to the committee.     Leahy said he would be "delighted" to have freshman Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) join the committee. But Breaux's appointment was being resisted by Midwestern Democrats, who feel southern states are adequately represented on the committee.     An aide to Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) said the senator, supported by Midwestern Democrats, had not ruled out the possibility of moving to the committee.     The inability of the two parties to settle the matter could increase the possibility that the Democratic majority would be left untouched at 9-8.     The issue is expected to be resolved any day, Senate staff said.  Reuter &#3;
