PHILIPPINES TO IMPORT CEMENT FROM INDONESIA

The Philippines will import 250,000 bags of cement worth 375,000 dlrs from Indonesia by the end of the month to meet growing demand from the construction sector, Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said.     He told reporters that local cement manufacturers had stepped up production but were falling short of demand. "The only solution is to import," he added.     Concepcion said average monthly requirements of cement in 1986 were 6.7 mln bags while supply hovered around 9.3 mln bags, but this year demand had grown to 10.4 mln bags per month.     Trade and Industry sources said construction sector representatives estimated an additional 70,000 bags would be required daily to meet demand.     Cement is officially priced at 48.50 pesos per bag, but construction industry sources said it was selling at black market rates of up to 65 pesos a bag in some areas.     The sources said falling interest rates as well as a government budget of four billion pesos in 1987 for low-cost housing had fuelled a construction boom.  REUTER &#3;
