LABATT STUDYING EXPANSION IN EUROPE

<John Labatt Ltd> is considering expansion in Europe, but has made no decisions as to strategy, according to spokesman I.C. Ferrier.     The company opened a London office about six months ago, and "we are prepared to invest in that area to see how one might do business over there," he said.     But the company has not decided whether it might open breweries, buy a European company or whether European expansion is feasible at all, he added.    Labatt feels Europe is a logical step for the company, since it is doing "reasonably well" in the U.S. and "there aren't too many other places" to expand profitably, Ferrier said.     In Canada, Labatt is the leading brewer, with about 41 pct of the market, according to market analysts. <Molson Companies Ltd> holds about 32 pct and <Carling O'Keefe Ltd> has 23 pct, analysts estimate.
