GATT AIRCRAFT COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS AIRBUS SUBSIDIES

The United States will press its case that the European Airbus airliner is unfairly subsidized at a special two-day session of the GATT civil aircraft committee opening today, trade officials said.     Washington has called for the meeting of the 20-nation committee to pursue a long-running dispute with the European Airbus consortium.     It has charged that the Airbus consortium is unfairly subsidized by Britain, France and West Germany, arguing the subsidies amount to unfair competition to its aircraft industry, including Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.
