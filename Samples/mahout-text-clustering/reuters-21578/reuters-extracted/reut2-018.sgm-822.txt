SALOMON INC <SB> SAW REDUCTION IN REVENUES

Salomon Inc had a reduction in trading revenue in April and May, managing director Robert Salomon said in response to questions.     Analysts have said they believe the lower second quarter profit predicted by Salomon Inc was partially the result of trading losses and lower revenues from low trading volume. They said they believe the firm, like others on Wall Street, suffered most from the turbulent weeks for the bond market in April.     Robert Salomon would not comment on whether the firm had actual trading losses, but he said he would not "quarrel" with a New York Times article that said the firm's losses could have amounted to 100 mln dlrs.     "We haven't acknowledged any trading losses other than to say that April was a difficult month, and you can presume anything you want from that. we don't have a quarrel with the new york times article," Salomon said.      "There cleary was a reduction in the amount of revenues generated in April and May was a little bit better," he said.     The New York times attributed the figure to analysts and unnamed Wall Street officials it said were familiar with the firm's activities.     Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund today in a statement reiterated that the firm expects a profit in the second quarter but sees lower earnings than last year's second quarter. Analysts lowered their estimates yesterday to about half of last year's 75 cts per share.     "We believe this showing is satisfactory within the framework of existing market conditions," said Gutfreund in a statement.  Reuter &#3;
