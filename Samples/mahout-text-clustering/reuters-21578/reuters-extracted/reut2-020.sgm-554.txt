MCDONNELL DOUGLAS <MD> IN PACT WITH CHINESE FIRM

McDonnell Douglas said it signed a technical assistance agreement with the China Great Wall Industries Co for possible use of its Payload Assist Module on the Chinese Long March series of rockets.     The company said the pact will serve as the basis for all future proposals involving the use of the Payload Assist Module in China.     "This agreement opens the door for us to proceed with proposals to the Chinese government or with spacecraft customers planning to use the Long March," said Daniel Green, the company's vice president of marketing.
