FAA ENDORSES SINGER <SMF> WIND SHEAR SIMULATOR

Singer Co said its flight simulator designed to train pilots in dealing with wind shear was endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA.     The wind sheer profile will be available on all of Singer's SimuFlite Training International Phase II jet simulators by mid-1987, the company said.     While the company can use the device to train pilots without the FAA evaluation and qualification, it said the FAA act is an endorsement.  Reuter &#3;
