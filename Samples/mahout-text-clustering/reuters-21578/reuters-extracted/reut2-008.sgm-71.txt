ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS TAX RISE NEEDED, DIFFICULT

U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said a tax increase probably would be needed but that Congress and President Regan might not approve one.     Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, also told the Futures Industry Association that he did not think congressional tax writers would approve a tax on stock transfers or ease taxes to promote U.S. Exports.     He congratulated House Speaker James Wright for proposing tax increases to help cut the budget deficit.     Rostenkowski said he hoped White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker could persuade President Reagan to support a package of tax increases and spending cuts.     He noted that Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker both supported tax increases in l982.     Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of new taxes might have to be found, along with nine billion in defence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domestic spending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would be brought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders felt there was Republican support.     A string of indictments of Wall Street figures could move some in Congress to support a tax on stock transfers, he said.     "But the fact many people don't like what's happening in financial markets doesn't mean they will be hit with a tax," he said, noting that Wright's securities tax idea had not been "fleshed out."     Efforts by special interests to rewrite provisions of the tax reform bill will fall on deaf ears, Rostenkowski predicted.     The chief House tax writer also predicted congress would approve legislation to reform the welfare system.  REUTER &#3;
