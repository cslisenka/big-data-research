REGULATOR SEES UPTURN IN TEXAS ECONOMY

The downturn in the Texas economy has bottomed out and growth should return at a slow rate in the second or third quarter, said Coyle Kelly, executive assistant to the chairman of the Texas Public Utilities Commission.     "Indicators are pointing to a turnaround ... but uncertainty still remains," he said at a meeting of utilities analysts.     The state's economy will begin to expand by the end of the year, he said, but growth will be flat when averaged over the full 12 months.     Kelly said his projection assumes oil prices in the range of 15 dlrs to 19 dlrs a barrel.     He added that the oil and agriculture sectors were still severely depressed but that there are scattered signs of improvement in the industrial sectors.  Reuter &#3;
