U.S. PRESENTS MOSCOW WITH DRAFT MISSILE TREATY

The United States today handed Soviet arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slash such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side.     Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussing medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table.     The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish "Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces elsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday.     The developments have been described by many disarmament experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since they resumed arms control talks in March 1985.     Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half hour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Soviet team on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov.     He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to be because we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities."     The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction - of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over five years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic warheads on each side, Glitman added.     In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20's and 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles.  Reuter &#3;
