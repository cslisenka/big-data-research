BRAZILIAN FIRM SAYS WESTINGHOUSE WILL COMPENSATE

Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX>, which designed Brazil's only nuclear plant, has agreed to pay 50 mln dlrs compensation for errors made during the project, the plant's operators said.     A spokesman for <Furnas Centrais Eletricas>, a state utility which runs the Angra One power station, confirmed a statement made in Washington last week by company president Camilo Penna.     Penna did not say what errors had been made and the utility spokesman said he could not add to Penna's statement.     The 636-megawatt plant, dogged by technical problems, started operating in January 1985, but since January 1986 has not worked at all due to a variety of problems, the utility spokesman said.     The country originally intended to have eight more power stations after Angra One, using West German technology.     Work on one plant, Angra Two, began and then stopped when funding ran out. Penna told the Jornal do Brasil that the state utility was receiving money from the government to finish Angra Two and build another plant, Angra Three.  REUTER &#3;
