W. AFRICA CENTRAL BANK WANTS IMF PARTICIPATION

The Governor of the Central Bank of West African CFA franc zone countries (UMOA) today urged that the bank should be involved in all negotiations with the International Monetary Fund but said the zone's seven member countries were not thinking of ditching the fund.     Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-day meeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank's participation in future credit talks with the IMF would promote a greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.     But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a new relationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break with the fund.     "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with the Fund," he said.     Fadiga said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory Coast's inland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the need for growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.     "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," he added.     UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFA franc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFA francs to one French franc.     Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from low commodity prices and a weak dollar.     He applauded last week's agreement between producers and consumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact, saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefit UMOA countries.     He also urged action to persuade West Africans to transfer more money through the regular banking system rather than using non-official channels.  Reuter &#3;
