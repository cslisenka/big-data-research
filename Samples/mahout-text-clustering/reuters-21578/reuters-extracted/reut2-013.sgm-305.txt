JAPAN CONSIDERING BUYING U.S. SUPERCOMPUTER

Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is considering buying a U.S.-built supercomputer worth three to four billion yen, but a final decision and funding have yet to be determined, MITI said.     The Cray II computer, made by Cray Research Inc <CYR>, would be used jointly by nine MITI research institutes in Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, a MITI official told Reuters.     Its purchase would be in line with MITI's goal of boosting imports, he said.     Funds for the supercomputer are not included in the fiscal 1987 budget currently stalled in parliament.     Funds could be provided in a supplementary budget likely to be introduced this autumn, the official said.     The U.S. Has strongly urged Japan to open its public sector to sales of U.S. Supercomputers, and the complaint is a key issue in current U.S.-Japan trade friction.     One year before it was privatised in April 1985, <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) bought a Cray supercomputer, an NTT official said, the only public sector purchase of a U.S. Supercomputer to date.
