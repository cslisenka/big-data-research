GERMAN BANKING PANEL SAYS SHARE FALL EXAGGERATED

Monday's international share crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economic fundamentals, Wolfgang Roeller, president of the West German banking association BDB said in a statement.     "A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 is totally inappropriate," Roeller, also chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said.     The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were being held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund and World meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for global economic development.     Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharp tightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise in interest rates, Roeller said.     "This applies in particular to West Germany," he said.     As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. They would not ignore long-term economic factors.     International cooperation on currencies established by the Louvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, would stand the test, he added.
