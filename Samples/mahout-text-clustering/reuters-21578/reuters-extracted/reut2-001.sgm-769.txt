FORMER BANK CHAIRMAN ADMITS ACCEPTING BRIBES

The former chairman of Peoples National Bank of Rockland County, N.Y., pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and income tax evasion.     Leonard Slutsky, 41, faces up to five years in prison on each of two counts of bank bribery and tax evasion. He could also be fined up to 745,000 dlrs.     In his guilty plea before Judge Charles Brieant of the White Plains, N.Y. branch of U.S. District Court, Slutsky admitted accepting payments from a tax shelter promoter. Peoples had lent money to investors in the tax shelter. The bank was declared insolvent in September, 1984.     Another former official of the bank, Samuel Yonnone, 37, pled guilty today to conspiring to accept money from a broker to make false entries in the bank's books. Yonnone, who was senior vice president of the bank, faces five years in jail and a 250,000 dlr fine.     The 41-year-old Slutksy admitted accepting 165,000 dlrs in bribes.   Reuter &#3;
