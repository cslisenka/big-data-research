U.K. GOVERNMENT ISSUES INSIDER DEALING SUMMONS

The Department of Trade and Industry, DTI, has issued insider dealing charges against a former employee of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc <BCOM.L>, a DTI statement said.     DTI is charging Ronald Richard Jenkins, until recently employed by British and Commonwealth's subsidiary Cayzer Irvine and Co Ltd. He is to appear April 27 in a London court.     The summons is the second insider dealing prosecution launched by the government under recent legislation.     The charges allege two insider dealing offences in securities of B and C and <Steel Brothers Holdings Plc>.     A DTI spokesman said plans to prosecute follow a probe into the matter since mid-December by a lawyer and a London Stock Exchange official who were officially appointed by the DTI as inspectors.     In November, B and C said an unnamed employee had resigned after he was discovered buying shares in Steel Brothers just before B and C announced an agreed bid for the 55 pct of Steel which it did not already own.     The attempted trade, which was subsequently cancelled, covered 2,500 Steel shares purchase at 595p compared with a bid price at 630p.  Reuter &#3;
