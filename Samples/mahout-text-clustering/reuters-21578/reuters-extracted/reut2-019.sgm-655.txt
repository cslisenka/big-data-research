U.S. CONGRESS RESOLVES CREDIT CORP FUNDING CRISIS

Congress's long-awaited agreement last Friday on an urgent bill to fund government operations is expected to clear the way for the Agriculture Department to unlock its coffers, closed since May 1.     House and Senate negotiators, breaking an extended logjam over fiscal 1987 funding, agreed to appropriate 5.6 billion dlrs to the Commodity Credit Corp.     The bill, which is expected to be approved by both Houses this week and signed into law soon by the president, would cover all farm program costs through September 30 and provide a 1.0 billion dlrs cushion, congressional sources said.
