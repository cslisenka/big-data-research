FINNISH PRIME MINISTER AND GOVERNMENT RESIGN

Finnish Social Democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa and his centre-left majority government resigned formally, clearing the way for the Conservatives to re-enter government after 21 years in opposition.     The resignation was in line with tradition following the March 15-16 general election which gave the Conservatives nine more seats and a current total of 53 in the 200-seat chamber.     President Mauno Koivisto asked the outgoing coalition of Social Democrats, Centrists, Ruralists and Swedish members government to stay on in caretaker capacity, officials said.  Reuter &#3;
