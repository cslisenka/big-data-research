PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT FALLS

Portugal's minority centre-right government was ousted in a parliamentary censure vote backed by three left-wing opposition parties.     President Mario Soares, who returns from a visit to Brazil on Sunday, now faces the task of either forming a new government or calling an early general election.     The Socialist Party, Democratic Renewal Party and Communist Party, with 140 of the 250 parliamentary seats, voted for the motion against the ruling Social Democratic Party and its Christian Democrat allies.
