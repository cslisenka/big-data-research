SENATE DEFEATS MOVE AGAINST NICARAGUAN REBEL AID

The Senate defeated a move to block dlrs 40 mln in military aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels, virtually assuring the aid will go through.     The 52-to-48 vote was a victory for President Reagan, who made the contra program the centerpiece of his Central American policy.     The vote virtually guaranteed that 40 mln dlrs -- the final installment of a 100 mln-dlr aid package approved by Congress last year -- would reach the rebels fighting the leftist Managua government.
