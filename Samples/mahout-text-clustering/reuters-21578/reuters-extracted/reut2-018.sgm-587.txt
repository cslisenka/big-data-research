SALOMON <SB> SEES LOWER 2ND QTR

Robert Salomon, managing director of Salomon Inc, said the company's second quarter is "likely to be comfotrably in the black, but down from the comparable year-ago quarter," when Salomon earned 117 mln dlrs or 78 cts a share on a primary basis.     "Its been a difficult quarter," Salomon told Reuters, adding that financial analysts today lowered their second quarter earnings estimate for the company to 30 cts to 50 cts per share from a range of 75 cts to 80 cts a share.     Salomon's stock closed at 34-3/4, off one, on heavy trading.         Salomon said he was deluged with calls from analysts after yesterday's announcement by First Boston Inc <FBC> that it will report a loss for the second quarter due to steep losses in the bond market during April.     Salomon acknowledged that the quarter was "difficult" but said the company will report a profit for the period.  Reuter &#3;
