WHITE HOUSE STAFFER CONSIDERED TO HEAD CFTC

A White House associate personnel director, Mark Sullivan, emerged as a possible candidate to replace Susan Phillips as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).     Commodity industry and government sources said Sullivan, who is not well known to the commodities industry, has emerged this week as a surprise candidate for the post.     Sullivan, an attorney, has been in charge of Reagan administration personnel appointments in the legal and financial affairs areas since July, 1986.     Phillips resigned last month to assume the post of vice president of finance at the University of Iowa.     Following Phillips' resignation CFTC commissioner Kalo Hineman, a Kansas farmer, or commissioner Robert Davis were considered the strongest candidates to head the agency, at least temporarily.     However, industry sources said the strong speculation about Sullivan suggests he now is the leading candidate.     Sullivan's name has also been floated recently for other Reagan administration financial regulatory positions. He was rumored in April to be under consideration for a position on the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates Savings and Loan Associations.  Reuter &#3;
