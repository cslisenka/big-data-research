S. KOREA SETS RULES FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKET

Shares of about 1,700 firms are expected to be traded in South Korea's first over-the-counter market due to open next month, finance ministry officials said.     Companies which have been operating for more than two years with paid-in capital of 200 mln won or more will be allowed to join the market, they said citing a guideline prepared by the ministry.     Firms using venture capital can take part in the market regardless of their size, according to the guideline. The officials said the over-the-counter market was aimed at helping small companies diversify their fund-raising sources.     The guideline requires companies wishing to take part in the market to register with the National Securities Association. Shares of registered firms will be traded through securities firms.     Companies with paid-in capital of 500 mln won or more can be listed on the Korea Stock Exchange three years after they are established, the officials said.     At the end of 1986, 355 companies were listed on the exchange.  REUTER &#3;
