WISCONSIN POWER <WPC> REPORTS RADIATION LEAK

Wisconsin Electric Power Co said a small amount of slightly radioactive water was released from its Point Beach Nuclear Plant at Two Creeks, Wis.     The company said 235 gallons of cooling water were released into Lake Michigan this morning as plant employees accidentally opened a valve while cleaning a holding tank.     The company said the radioactive water was heavily diluted and that it expects "no environmental or public health or safety impact as a result of this discharge."     Preliminary tests of lake samples detected no increase in lake water radioactivity, it said.  Reuter &#3;
