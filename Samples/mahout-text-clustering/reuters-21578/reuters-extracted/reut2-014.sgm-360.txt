CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES HIGHER AT MIDSESSION

CBT soyproduct futures continued to trade higher in light midsession trade, with deferred months up most, supported by the strong tone in the nearby soybean pit, traders said.     Soymeal held gains of 0.70 dlr to 2.00 dlrs per tonne, with steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis values this morning, plus trade-talk of additional processor down-time in the U.S over the next few weeks, adding to the positive tone in meal futures, they said.     Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton were the featured outright buyers of May soymeal, with Cargill spreading May/July at 0.20 dlr premium May, pit brokers said.     Soyoil futures were up 0.11 to 0.15 cent per lb, supported by steady commercial buying.  Reuter &#3;
