UAW CHEERS CALL FOR "WAR" ON GM AND FORD

Leaders of the nation's unionized automobile workers have signalled their intent for a major work stoppage later this year if General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Co., fail to satisfy demands for job security, pay raises and protection against shifting U.S. production to foreign sources.     United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber was loudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special bargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the 1.1-mln-member union is ready to go to "war" against the major auto makers in support of its goals.     "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ... and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the insecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.  Reuter &#3;
