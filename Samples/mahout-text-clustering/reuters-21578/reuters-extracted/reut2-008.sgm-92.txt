HUSSEIN SAYS IRAN'S YEAR OF DECISIVENESS FOILED

President Saddam Hussein said Iraq had foiled Iran's promise of a decisive victory in their war but acknowledged the latest fighting cost his nation higher losses than previous battles.     Hussein warned his frontline troops to expect further Iranian attacks to spoil celebrations being organised throughout Iraq to mark what Baghdad has hailed as the failure of Iran's so-called year of decisiveness.     Iran's leadership had pledged a decisive breakthrough in the 6-1/2-year-long war in the Persian year -- which ended yesterday -- and mounted a major offensive towards Iraq's second city of Basra, on the southern front, in January.     Iraq has never given any casualty figures but Hussein conceded they were high.     "It was clear to all of us the fighting this time would be long and severe with more blood flowing than in previous battles and that we would lose more of our loved ones than we have before," he said in a speech read on radio and television.
