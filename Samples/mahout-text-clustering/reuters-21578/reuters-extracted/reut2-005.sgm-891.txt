GUYANA PRESIDENT CALLS POISON SCARE "MISCHIEVOUS"

President Desmond Hoyte said recent reports of widespread thallium sulphate poisoning in Guyana were mischievous and had gravely damaged the country's food exports.     "There is no thallium sulphate poisoning epidemic in Guyana, as has been rumored," Hoyte said in a radio address late Sunday.     Reports of a spate of poisonings from the chemical had led some newspapers in the Caribbean to call for a ban on food exports from Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had restricted imports of Guyanese rice, Hoyte said.     Thallium sulphate, banned in many countries and blacklisted since 1973 by the World Health Organization as a deadly chemical, has been used by Guyana's state sugar corporation as a rodent poison.     Calling the reports a "mischievous invention," Hoyte said tests had shown some of Guyana's main exports, such as wheat and flour, were not contaminated.     Hoyte based his statements on tests conducted by the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization, which found only seven cases of thallium sulphate poisoning thus far.  Reuter &#3;
