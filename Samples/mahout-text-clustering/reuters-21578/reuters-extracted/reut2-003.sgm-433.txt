NEW ZEALAND FOREIGN DEBT EXPECTED TO KEEP FALLING

New Zealand's total foreign debt will continue to decline as major energy projects are refinanced, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.     Statistics Department figures show total debt fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion in September, although the government's share rose to 21.32 billion from 20.75 billion.     Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting of reserves to refinance so-called "Think Big" projects.     "These reserves do not add to New Zealand's total indebtedness.... They are money in the bank," he said.     "As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project are completed, existing loans will be replaced with debt currently held in reserves for this purpose," Douglas added.     This in turn will result in a drop in quasi-government and private debt, he said.     He said refinancing of projects allowed the government to borrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debts more effectively.     "Both of these will reduce the cost of Think Big to the taxpayer over time," he said. "The refinancing also paves the way to deregulation of the oil industry."  REUTER &#3;
