POINDEXTER MAY GET IMMUNITY TO HELP TRACK FUNDS

Congressional investigators tentatively plan to grant immunity to former presidential National Security Advisor John Poindexter who they say may help track missing money from Iran arms sales.     Congressional sources told Reuters the House of Representatives and Senate committees probing the arms scandal are expected to back a preliminary accord reached last Friday by their legal advisors to grant Poindexter immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony. He would be the first leading figure in the affair to be granted immunity.     Poindexter resigned from his White House post in November when it was divulged that up to 30 mln dlrs in arms sales profits might have been diverted to Nicaraguan contra rebels. Congressional investigators and a presidential review commission have not tracked beyond secret Swiss and Cayman Island bank accounts mlns of dlrs said to have been diverted.     The sources said Poindexter could help trace the money, which is one of the big riddles of the scandal. "Obviously we think he is a very important witness," said a House source.     Poindexter has refused to testify before Congress, citing his constitutional rights against self-incrimination.  REUTER &#3;
