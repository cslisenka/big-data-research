U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRATS SET 36 BILLION DLR CUT

House Democratic budget writers hope to win budget committee approval of a budget package to cut the deficit more than 36 billion dlrs perhaps as early as tomorrow, committee sources said.     After several weeks of closed sessions, Democrats are ready to present to the full committee tomorrow a package to cut the congressionally estimated 171 billion dlr deficit in 1988 by about 36 billion dlrs, half through revenues.     The plan could cut 9 billion dlrs from defence spending levels of 290.5 billion and 9 billion dlrs from many domestic programs, excluding Social Security.  Reuter &#3;
