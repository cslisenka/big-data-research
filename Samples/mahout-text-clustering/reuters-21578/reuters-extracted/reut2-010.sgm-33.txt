CFTC OFFICIALS SEE NO MERGER WITH SEC

Officials of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said merging the agency with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not help regulation of commodities and securities markets.     "I don't think that a merger would solve regulatory problems," CFTC chairman Susan Phillips told the House Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.     "I think what does solve our problems would be working with other agencies in a strong capacity," she said in response to a question. "We don't want agencies to trample on our jurisdiction either."     CFTC Commissioner Fowler West said, "We ... do not have the expertise to regulate securities markets. I don't think the SEC has the expertise to regulate the futures markets."     Increased attention to price volatility in stock index futures markets and reports of alleged futures trading abuses have raised concerns Congress may adopt a radically different regulatory structure for securities and futures markets.     Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over securities regulation, has said he will hold hearings on the questions of market volatility and alleged trading abuses.
