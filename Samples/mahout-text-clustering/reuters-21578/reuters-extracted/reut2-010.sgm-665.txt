YAO SAYS CHINA TO RESHUFFLE LEADERSHIP BY OCTOBER

A top level political reshuffle following the January removal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang will take place at a party conference later this year, Vice-Premier Yao Yilin said Saturday.     Yao told a news conference Zhao Ziyang would go on holding the jobs of Premier and acting Communist Party chief until the 13th party congress, due to be held by October.     Yao gave the news conference in the Great Hall of the People along with Vice-Premiers Li Peng and Tian Jiyun, the two main contenders to succeed Zhao as Premier.     Western diplomats say Li, a technocrat who studied in the Soviet Union, is the most likely successor.     Li appeared to go out of his way to deny any special sympathy with Moscow. In answer to questions, he said he had never met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when both studied in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and had since met him on only two occasions, both of which had been reported in the news media.     Asked what China could learn fromn the Soviet economic system, Li said the main lesson was to avoid excessive centralism and rigid control over economic activities.     "We do not totally reject the planned economy, but we are opposed to rigid control in the planned economy which hampers initiative and enthusiasm of the grassroots enterprise," Li said.     On Taiwan, Yao repeated Chinese policy of not ruling out force to regain the nationalist-ruled island, but did not repeat an official statement earlier this week that the goal was to achieve reunification by the year 2000. "As for reunification, it is our hope that it will be achieved through peaceful means, but we have not eliminated the possibility of taking non-peaceful means to achieve that process," he said.
