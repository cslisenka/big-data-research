CHINA REPORTS BREAKTHROUGH IN TALKS WITH USSR

After years of refusal, Moscow has agreed to discuss the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea in its talks with Peking on normalising relations, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said.    He told a news conference: "Recently the Soviet Union expressed agreement to discuss this question."     China has long referred to three obstacles to better relations -- Soviet troops in Afghanistan, Moscow's support for Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea and Soviet troop concentrations along the Chinese border.
