Status Game Corp said it has started making condom vending machines which it will start distributing within the next 30 days.     It said initially it will place the machines in the 1,200 Nevada locations in which it has other vending machines. But it said it has already received a substantial number of inquiries from potential customers in Europe, Canada and the U.S., including two large English breweries which each operates over 5,000 pubs.
