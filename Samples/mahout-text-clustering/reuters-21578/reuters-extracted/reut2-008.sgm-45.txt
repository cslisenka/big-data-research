WIEBOLDT'S TO CLOSE EIGHT STORES

Wieboldt's Department Stores, in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since September 1986, said as part of an agreement with creditors it will operate its four largest and most productive stores but close the remaining eight stores.     It said 341 employees of its remaining 885 employees will be laid off or terminated as a result.     The company also said it established a fund of about 12 mln dlrs to be available for payment of creditors' claims.     The retailer said it would continue to operate its four largest and most productive Chicago area outlets - State Street, Randhurst, Harlem-Irving and Ford City.  Reuter &#3;
