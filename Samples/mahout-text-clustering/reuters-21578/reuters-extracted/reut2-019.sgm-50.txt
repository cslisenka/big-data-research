Sales in 1987/88 are estimated at 15,100 billion yen, up 2.3 pct from a year earlier.     The company earlier reported group net profit of 20.07 billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1987, up 8.6 pct from a year earlier, helped by a drop in sales and administration costs and reduced interest charges.
