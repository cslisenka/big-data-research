DOCTORS FIND LINK BETWEEN AIDS, SMALLPOX VIRUS

In a discovery that could complicate the search for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors said they have uncovered a potentially-fatal interaction between the AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox.      Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits for AIDS before vaccinating them.     The findings, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.      "Our case report raises provocative questions concerning the ultimate safety of such vaccines," said the group led by Dr. Robert Redfield.      The report also throws into question the belief held by some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox, could be further modified to protect people against a host of other diseases.
