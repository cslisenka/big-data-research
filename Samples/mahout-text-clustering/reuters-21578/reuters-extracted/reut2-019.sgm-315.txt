CANADIAN CHEMICAL PRODUCERS SET TRANSPORT CODE

The 72-member Canadian Chemical Producers Association said it adopted a code of practice for the safe transport of chemicals and their by-products.     "Through cooperation with the transportation industry, we will not only minimize transportation accidents but also the risks to people and the environment," association president David Buzzelli said at the annual meeting in Jasper.     He said as a first step the association will conduct an internal survey rating the safety capabilities of trucking companies that transport chemicals.                       Reuter &#3;
