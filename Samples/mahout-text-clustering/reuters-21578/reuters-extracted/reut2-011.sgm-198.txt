SPANISH AIRLINES CRIPPLED BY GROUND STAFF STRIKE

About 40,000 passengers were stranded as Spanish airlines ground staff staged their second 24-hour strike for wage rises in five days, the airlines spokesmen said.     They said the state-owned airline Iberia cancelled 300 domestic and international flights, and Aviaco maintained 10 of about 80 scheduled flights.     A spokesman for Madrid's Barajas airport said foreign airlines were operating normally.     Airlines ground staff have announced more strikes for April 10 and 15 to coincide with stoppages by railways workers and drivers of petrol tankers.  REUTER &#3;
