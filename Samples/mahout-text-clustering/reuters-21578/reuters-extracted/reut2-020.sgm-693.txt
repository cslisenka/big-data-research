BURLINGTON NORTHERN <BNI> TO REPURCHASE STOCK

Burlington Northern Inc said it plans to repurchase up to five mln shares, or about seven pct of its common stock.     The company, joining a number of others buying back their shares in the wake of yesterday's maket decline, said it will make the purchases from time to time, based on market conditions.     Burlington said its operating businesses are performing well and are expected to continue generating substantial free cash flow.  Reuter &#3;
