USX <X>/WORTHINGTON PLANT REACHES DESIGN LEVELS

USX Corp said it and Worthington Industries <WTHG.O> Inc's Worthingon Specialty Products steel processing plant in Jackson, Mich., has recently reached production at the levels for which it was designed.     The company said the 600,000 short ton per year plant is designed to provide automotive, appliance and other customers with first-stage processed steel for just-in-time delivery.     It opened in August 1986, just as USX was beginning a six-month labor dispute. USX is sourcing the plant with coils from its Gary, Ind., works and Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh, and Worthington is operating the plant.  Reuter &#3;
