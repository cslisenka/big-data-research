COMINCO STRIKE TALKS STILL STALLED

Cominco Ltd has no contract negotiations scheduled this week with any of the five striking locals at the Trail smelter and Kimberley lead-zinc mine, union spokesmen said.     However, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to set up an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, John Owens, spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480 said.     Owens said Cominco has said the strike, which began May 9, is costing it five mln Canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are not covered by revenue. He said the company has not estimated total lost revenue.     Cominco spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.  Reuter &#3;
