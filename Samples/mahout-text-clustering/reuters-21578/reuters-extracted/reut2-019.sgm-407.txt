S/P AFFIRMS AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP>, UNITS DEBT

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed 6.3 billion dlrs of debt of American Express Corp and related entities.     Affirmed were American Express' AA senior debt, AA-minus subordinated debt and A-1-plus commercial paper.     S and P cited the American Express banking unit's decision to set aside specific reserves for developing country credits.     While a 600 mln dlr loan-loss provision will generate a second quarter loss and diminish equity capital, the reduction will be replenished by earnings in the second half of the year, S and P said.
