BRANIFF <BAIR> MAY GET MEXICAN SERVICE AUTHORITY

Braniff Inc said a U.S. Department of Transportation administrative law judge has recommended that a certificate be granted authorizing Braniff to operate air service for five years on a temporary and experimental basis between Dallas/Fort Worth and San Antonio, Texas, and Mexico City and Acapulco, Mexico.     The company said the recommendation must still be approved by Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and President Reagan. Braniff has been operating the routes under exemption authority granted by the Transportation Department in October.  Reuter &#3;
