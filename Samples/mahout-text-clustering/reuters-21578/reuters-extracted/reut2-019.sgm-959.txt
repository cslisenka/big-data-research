BRISTOL MEYERS <BMY> LOSES AIDS TESTS CASE

A U.S. judge denied Bristol Meyers Inc's request to halt Abbott Laboratories' <ABT> planned supply of AIDS tests to the Red Cross, a spokeswoman for Abbott said.     Judge Joyce Hens Green of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., rejected Bristol Meyers' request for a temporary restraining order against Abbott's contract, set to begin July one, to supply the AIDS tests, and tests for hepatitis, to be used on blood donated to the Red Cross, the spokeswoman said. She could not immediately provide Green's reasons for the ruling. A Bristol Meyers spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  Reuter &#3;
