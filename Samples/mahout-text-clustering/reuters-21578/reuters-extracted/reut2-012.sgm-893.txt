AMC <AMO> TO INSPECT 20,000 VEHICLES

American Motors Corp said it will ask Jeep dealers to inspect about 20,000 Cherokee, Wagoneer and Comanche vehicles equipped with 4.0-liter, 6-cylinder engines to determine whether the air control valve for the fuel injection system is out of design tolerance.     The company said it will seek about 5,000 affected vehicles, all 1987 models, manufactured between Jan 15 and March 3, 1987. It said the out-of-tolerance air valves may prevent the engine speed from returning to idle when the accelerator pedal is released, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
