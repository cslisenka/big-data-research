RIO TINTO SEES MODEST INCREASE IN METALS DEMAND

The consumption of some base metals, along with dollar prices, are showing signs of modest improvement, according to Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc (RTZ).     However, the company said, iron ore markets have weakened.     RTZ commodity specialist Philip Crowson told reporters he thought base metals industry forecasts for 1987 were erring on the side of caution, whereas forecasts for the last several years had proven over-optimistic.     RTZ said it expected to benefit from a rise in U.S. And industrial production in 1987. Earlier, RTZ reported 1986 net attributable profit of 245 mln stg against 257 mln in 1985.  Reuter &#3;
