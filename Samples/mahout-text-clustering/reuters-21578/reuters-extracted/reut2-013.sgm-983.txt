LIVE CATTLE FUTURES SET NEW HIGHS, THEN SLIP

Live cattle futures ran up for gains of 0.40 to 0.07 cent and again posted new season's highs in all months before slipping to trade 0.10 cent higher to 0.12 lower in latest dealings.     Futures ran up to new highs at the start on general carryover demand prompted by strong fundamentals. Higher live calls, tight market ready supplies and private reports of strength in cash beef stimulated demand. Strong stoppers of deliveries added to strength in April, traders said.     Professional and commission house profit-taking weighed on prices in latest trade, they said.  Reuter &#3;
