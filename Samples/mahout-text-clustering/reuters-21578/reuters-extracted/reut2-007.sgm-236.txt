U.N. ADVISES MINES TO FIGHT METAL SUBSTITUTES

Mining companies may have to develop specialty metals and metal-containing products if plastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroads in their markets, according to the United Nations.     In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on world mineral resources, U.N. experts termed conditions in the non-fuel mineral industry "unlike anything that has been experienced for the last half century."     Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded by diminishing use of the major and base metals and the development of substitutes in traditional markets, it said.     The report was prepared for a nine-day session next month of the U.N. committee on natural resources, an organ of the Economic and Social Council.     The gap between world productive capacity and demand would eventually be eliminated by closing mines, the report predicted.     "Although for the most part mining companies have been slow to develop specialty metals and metal-containing products and to develop markets for such products, it seems that such activities will be needed if plastics and other metal substitutes are not to make further inroads into the traditional markets for the major and base metals," the experts said.     "Integration of metal-producing and manufacturing enterprises between and among developed economies seems to be a likely consequence."     The report noted that, because of low prices, there was little incentive for new investment in mining except in the case of gold, which continued to attract investment at current prices with important increases in production in the past two years in North America, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Latin America.
