PERU STARTS PROCEEDINGS TO EXPROPRIATE BANKS

The government has begun judicial proceedings to expropriate five private banks under the recent nationalisation law, the official gazette said.     Advisories published in the official daily El Peruano said the Economy Ministry had begun court proceedings to expropriate the stock of the Banco de Lima, Banco Latino, Banco Mercantil, the Banco de Desarrollo de la Construccion and the Banco Financiero.     The owners of 10 private banks included in the law have said they would resist expropriation and riot police were used last week to install state administrators in the first two banks taken over.
