TREASURY STRENGTHENS TAX ENFORCEMENT, BAKER SAYS

Treasury Secretary James Baker said his department needs additional funds next year to ensure a smooth transition to the new tax code and to strengthen enforcement of the tax laws.     In testimony prepared for a House Appropriations subcommittee, Baker said the Treasury expects the lower marginal tax rates in last year's tax reform law to themselves promote taxpayer compliance and bring in additional revenue.     The Treasury is requesting 7.2 billion dlrs for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Its current year budget is 6.5 billion dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
