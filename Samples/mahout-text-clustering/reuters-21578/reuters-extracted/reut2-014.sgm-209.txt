SENATE FARM LEADER URGES HELP FOR RURAL AMERICA

The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee chairman said he wanted to develop a plan to help rural America, which he said has been neglected by the Reagan administration.      "I hope to develop a sound and comprehensive plan to revitalize rural America.... We need a renewed national commitment to rural America and we will have one," Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.     Leahy faulted the Reagan administration for having no strategy to revitalize rural America.     Leahy added that some rural countries were losing population and this was contributing to the economic decline.  Reuter &#3;
