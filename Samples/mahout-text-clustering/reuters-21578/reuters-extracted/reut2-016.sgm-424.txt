MITEL <MLT> HAS TWO NEW PRODUCTS

Mitel Corp said it introduced two new digital telephone switching systems and additional applications software for its current product line.     The new SX-2000s digital private branch exchange is a smaller version of the SX-2000, directed at line capacities of 100 to 500 telephone extensions. The other new product is the even smaller SX-50 for 30 to 100 telephones, with software specifications designed for the hotel and motel industry.     Mitel said it has developed new software packages to "extend the data capabilities of the SX-2000 to high speed applications found in an IBM-type environment."                       Reuter &#3;
