DOLLAR FIXED SLIGHTLY FIRMER IN PARIS

The dollar was fixed slightly above its opening levels in moderately active trading, dealers said.     The dollar was fixed at 6.0620 francs after an early 6.0565/90 and a late 6.0710/30 range yesterday, with dealers unable to pinpoint any specific reason for the slight rise.     However, the dollar was expected to remain in a narrow trading range ahead of the Washington monetary talks.     The mark was fixed at 332.70 francs per 100, after an early 332.72/75 against last night's late 332.70/72 range.  REUTER &#3;
