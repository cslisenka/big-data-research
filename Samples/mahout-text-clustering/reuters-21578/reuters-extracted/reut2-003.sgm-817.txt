FRENCH AEROSPACE INDUSTRY HAS MIXED 1986

The French aerospace industry had a mixed year in 1986, with military sales hit by the falling dollar and lower oil and raw material prices but the civilian sector performing better, Jacques Benichou, president of the the French aeronautics and space industries group (GIFAS) said.     He told journalists here that the sales success of the European Airbus Industrie consortium, in which France has a 38 pct stake through Aerospatiale, and the SNECMA aero-engine group, which has a 50 pct stake in CFM International with the U.S. Group General Electric, had both performed well.     Turnover for the French aerospace industry was 74 billion francs last year, comparable in constant terms with 1985, while the trade surplus for the industry was around 30 billion francs.     "We should be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic," Benichou said.  Reuter &#3;
