Tiffany and Co said it has filed for an initial public offering of four mln shares, including two mln to be sold by shareholders, at an expected price of 21 to 23 dlrs per share.     The company said the offering is expected to be made in late April or early May, with 3,200,000 shares being sold domestically through underwriters led by American Express Co's <AXP> Shearson Lehamn Brothers Inc and <Goldman, Sachs and Co> and the remainder are to be offered internationally, with the same lead underwriters.  It said it has applied for New York Stock Exchange listing.     Tiffany, a retailer of fine jewelry and gift items, said proceeds of the offering would be used to repay debt.
