BAA PLC UNIT WINS KANSAI AIRPORT CONTRACT

<British Airport Services Ltd> (BAS) has concluded an 18 mln yen contract with the <Kansai International Airport Co Ltd> for consulting work on the terminal at a new airport to be built in western Japan, the airport company said in a statement.     The contract is the first to be awarded to a British company and follows the award of a 200,000 dlr consultancy contract to a division of the U.S-based <Bechtel International Corp> in consortium with six Japanese companies, a company spokesman told Reuters. BAS is a subsidiary of <BAA Plc>, the former British Airports Authority.     The six-billion dlr project to build the airport has been a major source of friction with the U.S. And the European Community who have put pressure on Japan to allow foreign companies to compete with domestic firms in building it.
