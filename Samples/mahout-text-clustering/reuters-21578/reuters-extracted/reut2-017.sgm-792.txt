SEABROOK NUCLEAR STATION OWNERS SET ADVERTISING

Public Service Co of New Hampshire <PNH> said the owners of the Seabrook nuclear power plant approved a 1.2 mln dlr advertising campaign to inform the public about the plant's safe construction.     The campaign make a point that nuclear power provides one-third of New England's electricity and Seabrook is the ninth nuclear plant in the six-state region.     Operation of the plant has been delayed by the reluctance of officials in neighboring Massachusets to participate in evacuation drills. New Hampshire Public Service is operator of the plant and has a 35.6 pct interest in the facility.  Reuter &#3;
