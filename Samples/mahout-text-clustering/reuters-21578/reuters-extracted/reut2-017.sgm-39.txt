SETBACK SEEN FOR NAKASONE IN JAPANESE PARLIAMENT

Japan's Lower House passed the 1987 budget after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to a mediation proposal that could kill its plan to introduce a controversial sales tax, political analysts said.     The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax.     Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to step down just after the June summit of leaders from major industrial democracies, well before his one-year term is due to expire at the end of October.     The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. so that he could tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to boost the sagging economy and imports.
