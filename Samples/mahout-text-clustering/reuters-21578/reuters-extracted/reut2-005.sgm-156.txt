REAGAN SAYS HE WRONG IN SELLING ARMS TO IRAN

President Reagan for the first time admitted he was wrong to sell arms to Iran in an initiative which four months ago plunged him into the worst crisis of his six-year-old presidency.     He made the admission in a weekly radio address while defending the role played by Secretary of State George Shultz and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the affair.     He said: "In the case of the Iranian arms sale matter, both Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger advised me strongly not to pursue the initiative. I weighed their advice but decided in the end the initiative was worth the risk and went forward."     "As we now know, it turned out they were right and I was wrong. But they discharged their responsibilities as my advisers and as my subordinates," he said.     Since the scandal broke last November, Shultz and Weinberger have said they told Reagan of their opposition to the deal and were not fully informed of the effort, carried out by National Security Council members.     They also said they were unaware of the diversion of millions of dollars in profits from the arms sales to the Nicaraguan contra rebels, who have been fighting the leftist Managua government for six years.
