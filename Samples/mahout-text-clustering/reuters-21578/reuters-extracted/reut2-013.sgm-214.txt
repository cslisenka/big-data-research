PENNSYLVANIA BLUE CROSS TO PAY FOR AIDS TESTING

Capital Blue Cross and Pennsylvania Blue Shield said they will pay for diagnostic testing for their subscribers who may be infected with the AIDS virus because they received blood transfusions before 1985.     The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a coordinating body for the insurer's plans, said it had no nationwide policy towards AIDS testing for transfusion recipients concerned they were infected with the AIDS virus.     An association spokesperson said routine screening for AIDS was not covered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Blue Cross and Blue Shield cover about 75 mln people nationwide.      Reuter &#3;
