FRENCH FARMERS SAY U.S. SUBSIDISES MORE THAN EC

The United States subsidises its agricultural industry much more than the European Community, according to an internal USDA report, Marcel Cazale, President of the French Maize Producers' Association (AGPM), said.     He told reporters that according to what he described as a "confidential" report prepared by the USDA which he had seen, the US took the leading place regarding agricultural subsidies, ahead of the EC.     Cazale said according to the report, Argentina and Australia were the only countries not to subsidise their agriculture at all, or only by a small amount.     Cazale said in Argentina subsidies were granted for exports, but for a very small amount, while in Australia subsidies were also only for exports, amounting to 15 to 30 pct.     But Cazale said Australian agriculture received disguised aid to the extent that fuel and fertilisers benefited from tax reductions, and transport, electricity and telephones in the sector had special tariffs. He did not elaborate.  Reuter &#3;
