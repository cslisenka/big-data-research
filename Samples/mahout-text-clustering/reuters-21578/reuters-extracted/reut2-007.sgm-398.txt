RJR NABISCO <RJR> NOMINATES NEW CHAIRMAN

RJR Nabisco Inc said it nominated J. Paul Sticht to become chairman of the board, replacing J. Tylee Wilson, who will take early retirement.     Sticht retired as chairman and chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc in 1983.     Sticht's appointment will be voted on by RJR's board at its regular meeting on April 22, the company said.     The company also said F. Ross Johnson, 55, president and chief executive officer, will assume the additional post of chairman of the executive committee, succeeding Sticht, who is 69.     Wilson, 55, had said previously that he planned to take early retirement.     A company spokesman said Sticht will serve as chairman until April 1988, when he will retire. He said the appointment of Sticht was recommended by Johnson.     "These key management actions will significantly strengthen the company's leadership," Johnson said.     The company said James O. Welch, head of its Nabisco Brands unit, was named a vice chairman of the parent company.     It added that Robert J. Carbonell, an executive vice president, was promoted to the position of senior executive vice president of the parent.          Reuter &#3;
