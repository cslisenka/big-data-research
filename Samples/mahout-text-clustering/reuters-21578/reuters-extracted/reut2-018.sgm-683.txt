SYSTEMS/COMPUTER <SCTC.O> IN SETTLEMENT

Systems and Computer Technology Corp said it has received 4,879,000 dlrs from its former directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier in settlement of its claims for reimbursement of costs it incurred in connection with a class action and other suits filed against it from late 1984 through 1986.     The company said the amount will be recorded as a gain in its third quarter ending June 30, less a one mln dlr reserve being established for continuing legal fees and other expenses connected with ongoing litigation against its former president.     The company said it is continuing to pursue the claims against its former president in connection with events that required the restatement of results for fiscal 1983 and the first three quarters of fiscal 1984.     It also said its largest client, Temple University, has signed a new contract extending its use of Systems and Computer as an information provider until June 30, 1992.     The company said its backlog is now about 77 mln dlrs and is composed mostly of multiyear facilities management contracts.  Reuter &#3;
