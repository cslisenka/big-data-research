JAPAN DENIES REPORT IT MAY END CHIP PACT WITH U.S.

A Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official denied a local news agency report that Japan will end its seven-month-old semiconductor agreement with the U.S. If Washington imposes tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese electronic goods from April 17.     Kyodo News Agency reported a high-ranking MITI official as saying Japan would end the chip pact if the U.S. Implements the punitive tariffs.     Nothing new has been decided, the official said. As MITI said on Saturday, Japan would only pursue its rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he added.  REUTER &#3;
