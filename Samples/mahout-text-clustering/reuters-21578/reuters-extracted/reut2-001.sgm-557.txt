NATIONAL FUEL <NFG> PROPOSES ARGO REORGANIZATION

National Fuel Gas Co said it has proposed a plan of reorganization for <Argo Petroleum Corp>.     The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing Argo's debt to Seneca.     The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said.     National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs.     National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new company for its existing shareholders.     National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas properties.     Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly owned properties.     In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said.     It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange for their claims against the company.
