PARIS SUGAR AROUND LOWS BY MIDMORNING

White sugar futures were around morning lows in very quiet, featureless trading with the market looking to New York to provide impetus and perhaps an upside move, dealers said.     They said there was little outright trading with one Against Actual of 250 lots of May done and some May/August spread trading, mainly crosses.     May last traded at 1,146 francs a tonne after an opening 1,155, a low of 1,145, and a close last night at 1,164. August was at a morning low of 1,168 francs after an opening 1,180 and previous close at 1,188.  REUTER &#3;
