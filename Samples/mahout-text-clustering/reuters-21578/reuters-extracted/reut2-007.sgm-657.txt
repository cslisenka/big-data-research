ZAMBIAN SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL STRIKES SPREAD

A  teachers' strike has spread from Lusaka to the whole of Zambia, and a walkout by nurses has virtually paralyzed hospitals in the northern Copperbelt, the state-owned Zambia Daily Mail newspaper said today.     The teachers and nurses are demanding hefty pay raises, including a 50 pct increase in basic salary. But their strike action is unofficial, and the government has condemned the stoppages, warning that they could lead to violence.     The strikes broke out only three months after food riots in the Copperbelt last December, which left 15 people dead.     The stoppages began on Wednesday when 1,000 teachers in Lusaka and 200 nurses in the northern town of Kitwe decided to walk out in support of pay demands.  Reuter &#3;
