HOUSE VOTES TO OVERRIDE REAGAN'S BILL VETO

The House of Representatives voted 350 to 73 to override President Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway and mass transit funding bill.     The bill now goes to the Senate, which must also pass the bill by a two-thirds majority to override the veto.     Reagan vetoed the bill Friday, saying it was a budget buster and loaded with special interest projects.  Reuter &#3;
