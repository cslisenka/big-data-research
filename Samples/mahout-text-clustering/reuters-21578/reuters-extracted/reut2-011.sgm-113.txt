FORMER OWNER SENTENCED IN OHIO THRIFT COLLAPSE

Marvin Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in jail for his role in a bank failure that led to the worst banking crisis in Ohio's history.     He owned the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati at the time of its March 9, 1985, collapse following more than 143 mln dlrs in loses.     Warner and two other bank officials were charged with 82 counts of misapplying the bank's funds by transferring them to ESM Government Securities Inc., of Florida without the authorization of the bank's board.     ESM collapsed in March of 1985, taking Home State -- its biggest investor -- down with it.     Home State's failure wiped out the reserves of its insurer, the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a state regulated institution that was not federally insured. That prompted a run on dozens of other savings and loan associations across the state which were insured by the same fund, forcing some of them to close until they obtained federal deposit insurance.     Warner was ambassador to Switzerland during the Carter administration.  Reuter &#3;
