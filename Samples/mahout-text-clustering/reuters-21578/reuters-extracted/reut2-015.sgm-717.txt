U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT

The United States will push for a strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.     "Agriculture has really become the number one international economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.     At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders identified agriculture as a major international problem but made no specific recommendations.     This year, Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.     While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive" negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.  Reuter &#3;
