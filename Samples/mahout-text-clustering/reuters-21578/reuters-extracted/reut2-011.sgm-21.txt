SENATE BILL WOULD ALLOW FARM LOAN WRITE-DOWNS

The U.S. Senate has approved a measure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks to write off loan losses over ten years.     The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was attached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.     Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks with assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of total loans in farm loans -- to write down over ten years agricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.
