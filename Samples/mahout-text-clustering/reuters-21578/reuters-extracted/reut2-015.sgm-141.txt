IRAN SAYS OFFENSIVE AIMED AT DESTROYING IRAQ ARMY

Iran decided to continue its operations east of Basra to destroy Iraq's forces, Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio.     "That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction of (Iraqi President) Saddam's forces. This is why it was decided that the operations would forcefully continue there," he said.     "At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act throughout the length of the fronts," Mousavi told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.     Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early yesterday.     Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties.     Mousavi told Tehran radio that "on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam."     Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehran's forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraq's second city.     In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Iran's Ahvaz field.  Reuter &#3;
