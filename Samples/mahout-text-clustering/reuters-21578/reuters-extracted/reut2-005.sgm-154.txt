UNION LEADERS TOUR YUGOSLAVIA TO QUELL STRIKE

Yugoslav trade union leaders are touring the country in an attempt to quell a wave of strikes following a partial wages freeze, official sources said.     Eyewitnesses in the northern city of Zagreb reported far more police on the streets than normal after the city and areas nearby experienced the biggest wave of strikes in the country in recent memory.     National newspapers in Belgrade have given few details of the strikes. But Zagreb papers said thousands of workers went on strike and thousands more were threatening action over pay cuts.     Official sources said there were also strikes at a Belgrade medical centre, a food factory in Sambor, and enterprises in Nis, Leskovac and Kraljevo, as well as other towns.     They said national union officials were travelling throughout the country to speak to meetings in an attempt to restore calm.     But trade union leaders were avoiding making statements to the press and had not made their stand on the strikes clear.     Western diplomats said the strikes appeared to be spontaneous and without any unified orchestration.  REUTER &#3;
