NYSE TO REPORT IMBALANCES ON EXPIRATION FRIDAY

The New York Stock Exchange said it will cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission by disclosing imbalances in market-on-close orders in 50 major stocks thirty minutes prior to the close of trading Friday.     The procedure will be followed this Friday when stock index futures and options and individual stock options expire simultaneously. Such triple expirations occur four times a year and in the past have been associated with big swings in stock market averages. In a new variation of the disclosure rules, the NYSE said no market-on-close orders related to index arbitrage can be entered after 1530 EST.     The NYSE said all market-on-close orders for 50 big capitalization stocks, including the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, must be entered by 1530 EST Friday. The NYSE will then furnish to financial news services any imbalance in market-on-close orders of 10,000 shares or more.     After 1530 EST market-on-close orders in the 50 stocks can be entered only on the opposite side of the imbalance. But the bar on entering market-on-close orders related to index arbitrage after 1530 EST is a new element of the disclosure plan, which has the goal of making the market less volatile during the triple expirations.
