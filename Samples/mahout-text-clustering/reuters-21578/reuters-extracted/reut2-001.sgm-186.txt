GUARANTEE <GFCC> UNIT'S DEBT ON S/P WATCH

Standard and Poor's Corp said it placed the subordinated debt of Guarantee Savings and Loan Association, the principle unit of Guarantee Financial Corp, on creditwatch with positive implications.     About 57 mln dlrs of debt is affected.     S/P said the move follows Gurantee's definitive agreement to be acquired by Glendale Federal Savings and Loan, the fifth largest S and L in the U.S.     The combination with Glendale should enhance the creditworthiness of Guarantee's debt, S/P said.     Gurantee's subordinated debt is currently rated B.  Reuter &#3;
