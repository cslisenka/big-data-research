REAGAN SPEECH WINS MIXED REACTION FROM CONGRESS

Republicans in Congress hailed President Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid and constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, said Reagan would now have to match his words with action.     Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech is not enough to rebuild trust."     "President Reagan told the American people what they needed to hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said.     Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission report criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for the first time the Iran arms policy, and not just its implementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility for the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels.     Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the administration would "remain under a cloud" until several key figures in the scandal, including fired National Security Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John Poindexter, have told "the whole truth."     Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement of Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC.     Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure in admitting mistakes without apologising for them.     Some House Democrats, including Speaker James Wright of Texas, said earlier they would delay their reaction until tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its impact.  REUTER &#3;
