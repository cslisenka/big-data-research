NATIONAL CITY CORP <NCTY.O> SEES LOWER 2ND QTR

National City Corp projected income of eight mln dlrs for the second quarter ending June 30 due to a 55 mln dlr charge for loan loss provisions.     This compares with earnings in the second quarter of last year of 36.3 mln dlrs.     National City said it expects per share income in the second quarter to be 20 cts.     The company said it expects full year earnings to be comparable with last year's record 135 mln dlrs.     The bank said its 55 mln dlr special loan loss provision is related to loan exposure in less developed countries in its international portfolio.  Reuter &#3;
