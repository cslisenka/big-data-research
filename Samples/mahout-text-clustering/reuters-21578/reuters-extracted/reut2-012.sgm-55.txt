GPU'S <GPU> THREE MILE ISLAND POWER REDUCED

General Public Utilities corp said its Three Mile Island Unit One's power output has been cut to 81 pct of reactor power, or 730 megawatts of electricity, due to mineral deposits on the secondary or non-nuclear side of its two steam generators.     The company said the deposits do not affect the safe operation of the plant but interfere with the production of steam.     It said the unit was similarly limited in power in late 1985.
