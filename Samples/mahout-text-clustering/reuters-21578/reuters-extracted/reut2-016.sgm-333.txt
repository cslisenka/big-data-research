CBT MMI STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO EXPIRE THURSDAY

The Chicago Board of Trade's (CBT) April Major Market Index (MMI) stock index futures will expire 1515 CDT Thursday instead of Friday because of the Good Friday holiday, the exchange said.     The Chicago Board Options Exchange said April options on the Standard and Poor's 100 and 500 stock indexes, currency options and about one-third of the listed individual equity options will expire at their normal time Saturday, April 18, although the last day of trading will be Thursday in those contracts.
