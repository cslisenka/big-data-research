SEC SEEKS COURT REVIEW OF TEXACO <TX> CASE

Texaco Inc said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court to accept the Texaco, Pennzoil Co <PZL> case for review with respect to Commission Rule 10b-13 as it applies to the facts of the case.     Texaco said it is pleased and encouraged by the SEC's decision, pointing out "Pennzoil's own counsel told the trial court that 'If Rule 10B-13 was an impediment, then in fact our contract was void' and further that, if the alleged contract was void, "we have no case.'"     In a letter dated June 26, the SEC's general counsel told attorneys representing Texaco and Pennzoil the commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federal securities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case, Texaco said.     "This is to inform you that the commission has determined to file a brief amicus curiae in the (Texaco-Pennzoil) litigation. The brief will focus on Commission Rule 10b-13 as it applies to the facts of this case, and will urge the Texas Supreme Court to accept the case for review with respect to that issue," the letter said.     The SEC's general counsel said, "we currently anticipate that the brief will be filed around the week of July 20."     An issue concerning SEC Rule 10b-13 is part of Texaco's application for a Writ of Error, which was filed with the Texas Supreme Court on June 15, the company said.     "The SEC rule prohibits private agreements or arrangements to purchase a target company's stock while a tender offer by a prospective purchaser is pending," the company's statement said.         In its application to the Texas Supreme Court, Texaco said, it points out that "on the day that Pennzoil made its alleged agreement to purchase Getty Oil stock (Jan. 3, 1984), it (Pennzoil) had outstanding a public tender offer for Getty Oil stock."
