HU YAOBANG APPEARS AT CHINA PARLIAMENTARY SESSION

Former Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang attended a parliamentary session in his first public appearance since his dismissal in January.     Hu took his place on the platform of the auditorium of Peking's Great Hall of the People as 3,000 delegates gathered for the opening meeting of the National People's Congress annual session.     Hu was dismissed from the top Communist Party job after being accused of "mistakes" including a failure to combat Western political ideas.  REUTER &#3;
