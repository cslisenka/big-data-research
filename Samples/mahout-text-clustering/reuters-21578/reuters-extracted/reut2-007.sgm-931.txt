CENTRUST SAVINGS <DLP> TO RECAPITALIZE STOCK

Centrust Savings Bank said it will recapitalize its common stock at the close of business today, converting each share of outstanding common into 0.5 share of common and 0.5 share of series one participating stock.     Centrust said its shareholders previously approved the recapitalization at a meeting held on February 20, 1987.     Centrust said the series one stock, a newly created series of Centrust's capital stock, has enhanced voting rights versus the common stock. Series one holders generally will vote to elect 75 pct of the board of directors, while common shareholders will elect 25 pct, Centrust said.     CenTrust added that the common stock will have the right to vote along with the series one as a single class for the election of 75 pct of the board only if the number of outstanding "high voting stock," including the series one, falls below a certain percentage of outstanding shares of all classes and series of voting stock.     CenTrust said the common stock gets one vote per share, the series one gets ten votes per share and there is separate class voting on some matters.     CenTrust said series one dividends will be lower than common stock dividends until April 1, 1992.      Also the series one will have limited preferential dividend and liquidation rights and will be convertible into common stock.     Both series one and the recapitalized common stock shares are scheduled to begin trading on the American Stock Exchange on March 23, 1987.  Reuter &#3;
