COURT TO HEAR NEC LAWSUIT PETITION

Nec Electronics Inc said the U.S. Ninth District Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to hear the company's petition seeking the disqualification of the judge presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp <INTC.O>.     In granting the hearing the court directed Intel to respond to the NEC petition by July 16, NEC said.     The petition stems from a suit filed by NEC against Intel in 1984.     In its complaint NEC is seeking a judgement stating that microcode is not copyrightable subject matter and that the microcode NEC uses in its V-Series microprocessors does not infringe on any valid Intel corprights.     During May last year the judge presiding over the case, William Ingram, submitted a financial disclosure report to the U.S. Judicial Conference which showed that he owned Intel stock through an investment club throughout the proceedings, NEC said.
