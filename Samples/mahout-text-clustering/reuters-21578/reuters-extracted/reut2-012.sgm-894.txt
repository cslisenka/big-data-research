GERMAN, JAPANESE FIRMS WORK ON WASTE PLANT

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> said it agreed to cooperate with BASF AG <BASF.F> and the Japanese firm Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <KAWH.T>, KHI, in the field of technology designed to protect the environment.     Deutsche Babcock Anlagen AG would work with BASF to develop plants which would treat and burn industrial waste.     Another Babcock subsidary, Vereinigte Kesselwerke AG, VKW, had struck an accord with KHI which would later be transformed into a licencing agreement.     The agreement with KHI involves construction and marketing by the Japanese company of an environmentally-safe system developed by VKW for burners in power station boilers, Deutsche Babcock said.     No financial details of the cooperation were released.  REUTER &#3;
