REAGAN CALLS FOR W. GERMAN, JAPANESE GROWTH

President Reagan said he will use the annual economic summit of major industrialized countries to press for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan.     In a pre-summit speech at the White House, Reagan said that preserving a growing world economy was the business of every member of the world trading community.     "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bloster the world trading system on which they depend," he said.
