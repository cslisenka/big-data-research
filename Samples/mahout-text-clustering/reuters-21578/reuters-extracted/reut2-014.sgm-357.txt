U.S. GOLD FUTURES HOLD PARED GAINS AT MIDSESSION

Comex gold futures held pared gains at midsession after the metal repeatedly stalled in the face of trade selling resistance, analysts said.     They attributed gold's modest price rise to a buoyant silver market. Professional traders and investors again bought silver on speculation it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce.     The pacesetting June gold delivery traded at 423.60 dlrs an ounce, up one dlr but below a session high of 425.20 dlrs. Other contracts were 80 cts to 1.50 dlrs firmer.     Trading was thin as participants closely watched the foreign exchange and U.S. stock markets, brokers said.  Reuter &#3;
