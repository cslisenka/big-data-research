IRISH OIL CONCERN HAS 8.5 PCT OF CYNERGY <CRG>

Bryson Oil and Gas Plc, a Belfast, Northern Ireland, oil company, said it has acquired an 8.5 pct stake in Cynergy Corp and took steps to help it consider the possibility of seeking control or influencing the company.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it disclosed its stake, Bryson said it also asked Cynergy for a list shareholder list in case it decided to communicate with the holders.     Shareholder information would be vital to anyone planning a tender offer and is commonly requested by individuals or groups mulling takeover attempts.     Bryson told the SEC it may review the feasibility of trying to influence the management policies of Cynergy, or of trying to gain control of the company through representation on its board of directors.     A shareholder list would also be necessary for a group trying to mount a campaign for the election of directors.     Bryson, which said it has retained D.F. King and Co Inc to work on its Cynergy dealings, said it bought 841,887 Cynergy common shares for 5.4 mln dlrs to gain an "equity position" in the company. Last week, Texas developer James Sowell told the SEC he sold his entire 823,387-share stake in the company.  Reuter &#3;
