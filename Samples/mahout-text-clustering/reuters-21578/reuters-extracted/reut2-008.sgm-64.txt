HONG KONG LAND <HKLD.HK> DETAILS MANDARIN SPIN-OFF

Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HK> gave details of a previously announced spin-off of its 80 pct stake in <Mandarin Oriental International Ltd> and a 32 pct stake in <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> (JSH).     An offer document prepared by financial adviser <Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd> said Hong Kong Land offers shareholders 200 Mandarin shares at 1.54 H.K. Dlrs each and 93 JSH shares at 3.28 dlrs each for every 1,000 Hong Kong Land shares. But price of Mandarin may be lowered to 1.43 dlrs each, while shareholders may instead receive 86 JSH shares if all Hong Kong Land's existing warrants are exercised before April 28.     Hong Kong Land warrants are worth 725.92 mln dlrs.     Holders of the firm's 151.89 mln preference shares will receive a similar offer as ordinary shareholders.     The company also agreed to sell a 20 pct stake in Mandarin to Jardine Strategic for some 430 mln dlrs.     Hong Kong Land said last month it is expected to receive net proceeds of about 900 mln dlrs from the spin-off and the sum will be used either for expansion or to reduce its debts.     Hong Kong Land shares gained 30 cts to close at eight dlrs each yesterday, while JSH was up 50 cts at 12.90 dlrs.     Mandarin will commence trading on June 8.  REUTER &#3;
