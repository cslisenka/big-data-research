FDIC TO EASE RULE FOR BANKS' SECURITIES UNITS

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp proposed to ease its regulations on operations of securities subsidiaries of banks.     The FDIC proposed for comment for 30 days amendments to end a ban on the sharing of a corporate name and logo by a bank and its security unit.     It also said the securities subsidiary was no longer required to have an entrance separate from the bank's, but the bank's and subsidiary's separate office space must be marked.     The bank must inform customers that securities purchased from the subsidiary were not covered by FDIC deposit insurance.  Reuter &#3;
