MORTON THIOKOL <MTI> SELLING HEADQUARTERS

Morton Thiokol Inc said it has a tentative agreement to sell its downtown headquarters to Tishman Midwest Management Corp for undisclosed terms.     Thomas Russell, company spokesman, said the proceeds, representing a non-operating asset, will be reinvested into the operating part of its business.     The company will move 700 of its employees to a new location at the new Northwestern Atrium late this summer. Some 450 employees will move from the headquarters at 110 N. Wacker Drive and the other 250 will leave another downtown location.  Reuter &#3;
