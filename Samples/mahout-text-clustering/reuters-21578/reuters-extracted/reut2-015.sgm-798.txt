CRAXI SAYS HE IS RESIGNING

Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, whose five-party coalition government fell apart yesterday, told the Senate he was resigning.     Craxi said at the end of a Senate (upper house) debate on the government that he would go tonight to hand his resignation to President Francesco Cossiga.     Craxi's government collapsed when the majority Christian Democrats withdraw their 16 ministers from the 30 member cabinet yesterday. Craxi had been prime minister for three and a half years.
