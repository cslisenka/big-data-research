SEC SAYS COMPANY INFLATED 1982/83 INCOME

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Windsor Holding Co, a Chicago-based lamp and ceiling fan maker, with fraudulently overstating its 1982 and 1983 pre-tax income by a total of 3.6 mln dlrs.     Simultaneously with the filing of the civil case in U.S. District Court here, the company, formerly Windsor Industries Inc, three former officers and a former director, agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying them.     But under the settlement, the company and the other defendants consented to court orders barring them from committing further violations of securities law.     There were no monetary penalties in the settlement and the company, which was delisted from the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system in May 1985, was not required to restate its earnings.     The SEC charged Jose Arrojo, a vice president of a Windsor subsidiary, Ronald Kahn, former vice of the company, and David Garvin, former president of a Windsor subsidiary, with taking part in a scheme to inflate the value of Windsor's 1982 year-end inventory, resulting in a 2.0 mln dlr overstatement of the company's pre-tax income for that year.     The company's inventory was again falsified a year later, resulting in a 1.6 mln dlr overstatement, the SEC charged.     Another defendant, Arthur Usheroff, a former Windsor board member, the company and Kahn also failed to disclose in an SEC filing an arrangement under which Usheroff was compensated for services rendered in a 1983 Windsor public stock offering, the agency said.     Arrojo, Kahn and the company were also charged with making false statements in required SEC filings.     Windsor filed for bankruptcy in August 1985 and had a plan of reorganization approved last December.  Reuter &#3;
