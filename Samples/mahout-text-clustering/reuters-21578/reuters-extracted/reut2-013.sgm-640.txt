LONDON SILVER FIX HIGHEST SINCE APRIL 1985

Silver bullion was fixed at 674.50 cents an ounce, its highest since mid-April 1985, dealers said.     The metal continued to be supported by gold/silver ratio dealing, with traders buying silver and selling gold.     Dealers said the market also featured some panic short-covering.     Silver moved steadily higher during the morning after opening at 671/674, up from its previous close of 663/665.     Three months was fixed at 426.50 pence, up from last night's final 418.50/420.50.
