SENATE VOTE ON REAGAN'S VETO REMAINS IN DOUBT

A partisan battle over President Reagan's veto of an 88-billion dlr highway bill resumes in the Senate today after an apparent victory for the White House was left in doubt when a key Democrat switched his vote      The Senate yesterday had voted to sustain Reagan's veto by a narrow margin, but Democrats moved to reconsider the vote. Terry Sanford of North Carolina, the only Democrat to support Reagan, later said he had decided to vote to override when the bill is reconsidered.     If no other votes switch, the Senate would override the veto on reconsideration, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. He said Reagan and Administration officials would continue to lobby for votes to sustain the veto.     "As of right now, the vote would be 67 to 33 (in favor of the bill) and the veto would be overriden," Dole said.      After several hours of delay, Senate leaders were unable to agree on a time for a second vote and the Senate recessed until this morning with the issue unresolved.     Sanford denied he had been pressured to change his vote, but told the Senate, "I have talked to and have been talked to by a number of senators. I have thought a little more deeply about this vote."     The first Senate vote put Reagan on the verge of a political triumph he had sought to show he is rebounding strongly from the Iran arms scandal. &#3;
