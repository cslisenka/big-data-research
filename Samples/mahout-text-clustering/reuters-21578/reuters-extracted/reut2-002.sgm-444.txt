NPPC ELECTS NEW PRESIDENT

Delegates at the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis elected Tom Miller of Maricopa, Ariz as the new president of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC).     Miller, who was vice president of the NPPC the past two years, replaces Ron Kahle who served the maximum two-year term as president, the NPPC said.     Miller said the white meat campaign and the checkoff program are very important, but based on talk at the pork congress, farm credit is next in line.     Ray Hankes of of Fairbury, Ill was elected Vice President. Hankes was active in development of the "Pork - The Other White Meat" campaign, the NPPC said.  reuter &#3;
