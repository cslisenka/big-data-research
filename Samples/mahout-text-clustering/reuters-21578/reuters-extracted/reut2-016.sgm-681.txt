ANDOVER WAGES HBO <HBOC> PROXY WAR

Andover Group, a Virginia general partnership, said it mailed proxies soliciting votes for a slate of nominees to HBO and Co's board of directors.    Last week, HBO and Co sent a letter urging shareholders against the proxies.     Andover said HBO has consistently refused to provide it with internal financial information it considers essential to formulate an acquisition offer. If its nominees are elected, Andover said it will make a proposal to buy HBO on terms and conditions to be determined at that time.     The annual meeting is scheduled for April 30.  Reuter &#3;
