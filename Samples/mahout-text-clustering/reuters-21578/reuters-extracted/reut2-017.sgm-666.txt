CHI-CHI'S <CHIC> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it cut to B from B-plus 50 mln dlrs of convertible subordinated debentures of Chi-Chi's Inc.     The company's senior debt rating is BB-minus.     S and P said the action reflected poor performance from Chi-Chi's chain of 200 Mexican food restaurants. The agency also said that a planned repurchase of three mln common shares will result in reduced equity of 23 mln dlrs and a rise in debt leverage to 67 pct from about 60 pct in fiscal 1987.     Chi-Chi's posted a 5.7 mln dlr loss for the nine months ended January 31, S and P noted.  Reuter &#3;
