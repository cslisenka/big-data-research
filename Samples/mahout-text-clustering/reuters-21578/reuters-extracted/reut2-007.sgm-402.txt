PARIS BOURSE LIBERALIZATION NOT LIMITED TO BANKS

Industrial and financial groups will be allowed to take a share in stockbrokers' capital when Paris Bourse regulations are liberalized beginning next year, Stockbrokers' Association chairman Xavier Dupont told a news conference.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur announced on March 10 that the monopoly of French stockbrokers to trade on domestic bourses will be phased out by January 1992, the date for the creation of a unified European financial market.     Balladur said that from January 1988, the capital of the brokerage houses would be opened French and foreign banks.     The minister did not specify which other institutions would be allowed to take stakes in the brokers' capital but said that from January 1, 1992, "access to the Bourse will be open to any new member under the control of the Bourse authority."     Dupont said that in opening up the capital of the 45 Paris brokerage houses, the stockbrokers' association had "killed one of its sacred cows."     Association officials said Dupont would meet all the stockbrokers on March 31 for an exchange of views on the measures to be taken and future of the Bourse.  Reuter &#3;
