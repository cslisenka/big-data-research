S/P UPGRADES WILLIAMS COS <WMB> DEBT SECURITIES

Standard and Poor's Corp said it has upgraded approximately two billion dlrs of securities for the Williams Cos. and its related entities.     S and P said recent sales of non-regulated oil and gas, coal, fertilizer, and telecommunications assets significantly reduce business risk. With 900 mln dlrs of proceeds available to reduce debt, the financial profile should also improve.     Among issues upgraded were Williams' debentures, raised to BB-plus from BB-minus and Williams Natural Gas Co's debentures and preferred stock to BBB-minus from BB-plus. Northwest Pipeline Corp issues also were upgraded.  Reuter &#3;
