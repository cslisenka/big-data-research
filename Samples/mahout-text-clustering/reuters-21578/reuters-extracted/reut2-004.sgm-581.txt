CHRYSLER <C> TO KEEP AMERICAN MOTORS <AMO> PLANS

American Motors Corp president Joseph E. Cappy, in a telegram to dealers, said Chrysler Corp will retain American Motors' plans to begin selling four new cars within the next year.     Cappy reassured dealers that American Motors, if it is acquired by Chrysler, would go ahead with plans to introduce the "Medallion", "Premier", Premier "X59" coupe, and the "Alpine" models.     Cappy, in a statement, said American Motors' board met yesterday on the Chrysler buyout, and will meet "periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal." No other details of the Chrysler takeover were disclosed.     American Motors did not release further details of Chrysler's plans for maintaining or changing American Motors' current strategy other than to quote Cappy as saying, "we will try to keep you informed as developments warrant."
