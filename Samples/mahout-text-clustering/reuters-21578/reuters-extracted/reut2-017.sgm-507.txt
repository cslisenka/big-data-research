U.S. BOUGHT 16.5 MLN USED CARS, STUDY SAYS

American motorists bought 16,524,000 used cars last year at an average cost of 5,833 dlrs each for a total market of 96.4 billion dlrs, according to a yearly study by the Hertz Corp.     The study also showed an increase in used car sales of about 600,000 units over 1985 volumes while the average price rose about 400 dlrs.     But the survey said the typical used car that changed hands in 1986 was slightly newer at 4.5 years old and 41,140 miles than in the prior year, when such a car had run 45,270 miles and was 4.6 years old.     "The sample shows that retail sales volume for used cars turned up after two years of decline," said Leigh Smith, a Hertz Corp. spokesman.     "And while costs of ownership went up to 25.5 cents a mile for used cars from 25.05 cents in 1985, they remain 47 pct under the estimated 48.5 cents a mile cost to own and operate a new car."     The increase in activity appeared to be linked to the record market for new cars, which passed 11.4 mln domestic and imported models last year because of the unprecedented cut-rate loan incentive packages offered by the Detroit-based automakers and changes in U.S. tax laws.     The incentive campaigns were largely sparked by General Motors Corp <GM> in an attempt to reverse its slipping share of the American car market.  Reuter &#3;
