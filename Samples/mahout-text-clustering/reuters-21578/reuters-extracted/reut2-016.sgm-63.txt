SENATE PASSES HOMELESS AID BILL

The Senate approved a 433 mln dlr bill to aid thousands of homeless people sleeping on streets around the country.     The legislation was approved on an 85 to 12 vote but must be reconciled with a similar House-passed bill differing in some details.     The bill passed after Senate leaders managed on a 68 to 29 vote to break a filibuster that had blocked final action.     The filibuster was led by Republican Senator Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire who was trying to force an amendment to reverse a 12,100 dlr pay raise Congress approved earlier this year that boosted the lawmakers' salaries to 89,500 dlrs annually.
