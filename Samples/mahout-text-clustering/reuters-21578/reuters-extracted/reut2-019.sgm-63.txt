TOKYO STOCKS SEEN HEADING FOR POSSIBLE CORRECTION

The Tokyo stock market will probably not make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary correction, brokers said.     Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of uncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.     "Everybody is just trying to think through things and see exactly what is going on," said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co Ltd. "There is a lot of confusion," he added.     This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock prices over the last two days. Today the 225-share average ended 462.43 points lower at 25,288.12.     "People expect a correction next week. They don't care if the market falls to 24,000," the Sanyo broker said. "There is always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any correction."     Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull run to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts money from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of borrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.     "Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfolios to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more exporters," said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.     Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is unlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincing stock market investors to buy electronics, precision instrument, machinery and some other export-oriented manufacturing shares, brokers said.     "Some people are awaiting the results of proposed protectionist U.S. Trade legislation in July for clues to the currency direction," a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said.  REUTER &#3;
