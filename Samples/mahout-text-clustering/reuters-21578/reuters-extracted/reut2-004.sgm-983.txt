USDA'S EXPORT BONUS SAID TO AFFECT TRADE TALKS

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Export Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recent agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global trade talks, according to the General Accounting Office.     GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the cost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.     However, there is little reason to believe that once EEP expires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program will be sustained in targeted markets, he said.     Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it across-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination by traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, but antagonize non-subsidizing exporters.
