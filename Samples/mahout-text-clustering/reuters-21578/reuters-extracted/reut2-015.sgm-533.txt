EUROCHEQUE EXPECTS AROUND 10 PCT CARD GROWTH

The number of cards in the Eurocheque system, Europe's biggest personal payments system, grew by 11 pct to 39.1 mln last year and is expected to continue increasing by around 10 pct in coming years, Eurocheque International Secretary General Mark Van Wauve said.     He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be used in 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurocheques written in local currency and, where facilities are available, as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000 automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed to have 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.     Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.     Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already accept Eurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issue Eurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible these would be launched in Italy this year if the Rome government agreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writing cheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.     Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-based coordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from the Soviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.     Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them to charge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and Van Wauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded such commissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.     Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency for goods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28 countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the system this year. East Germany last year became the 40th country to accept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.     Eurocheque International estimated the total of Eurocheques used nationally and internationally at over one billion a year.  REUTER &#3;
