REAGAN SEEKS MORE AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA

President Reagan, seeking to salvage his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.     In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approval of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.     The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.     The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.     "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said.     Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefed reporters, said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested.     He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra scandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting Managua's leftist Sandinista government.     Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest fight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time in six years -- would back the military request.
