PARIS FUTURES MARKET TO NAME NEW MEMBERS

The Paris Financial Futures Market, MATIF, will shortly name 12 new members, bringing its total membership to 100 from 88, market officials said.     The 12 new members will be selected from a list of 28 candidates and priority will be given to foreign applicants with the aim of internationalising the market, they said.     The MATIF was set up in February 1986 with a founding membership of 44 brokers and 40 banks. Turnover currently averages about 20,000 contracts a day.  REUTER &#3;
