AIRLINES CAN INCREASE HONG KONG/MANILA FLIGHTS

State-owned Philippine Airlines Ltd (PAL) said it has agreed with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> to an increase in seat allocations on the busy Manila-Hong Kong route.     A spokesman told Reuters a memorandum of understanding would be signed later this week between the British and Philippine governments to allow the current total of 32 flights a week to be increased. "There are no immediate plans for more flights but it gives us flexibility," he said.     PAL said an agreement reached with British Airways would allow each carrier to keep three London-Manila flights weekly.  REUTER &#3;
