NY COCOA FUTURES CLOSE MIXED

Cocoa futures drifted into a dull finish, settling at nine dlrs lower to seven higher, with most contracts near unchanged from midday levels.     May closed nine dlrs lower at 1,925 dlrs. Estimated volume was 1,461 contracts.     Light selling based on weak London prices and continued offers by West African origins applied light pressure.     A report from London that traders question the supportive potential of newly-negotiated buffer stock rules was also depressing to prices, analysts said.     Bahia arrivals now total a cumulative 6,475,385 bags, private Brazil trade sources said, half a mln bags above the year ago count.  Reuter &#3;
