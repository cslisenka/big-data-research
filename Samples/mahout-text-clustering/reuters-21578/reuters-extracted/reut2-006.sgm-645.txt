EC COMMISSION THREATENS ACTION AGAINST AIRLINES

The European Commission said it could begin legal moves within the next month against three major airlines - Deutsche Lufthansa AG <LHAG.F>, Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane Spa <AZPI.MI> and <Olympic Airways> - accusing them of unfair fare-fixing and route sharing practices.     The Commission also announced a move designed to put pressure on EC ministers to agree by the end of June a new, more liberal, airline regime, which could bring lower fares and a greater choice of carriers for passengers.     The Commission has for years been pushing to force EC airlines to abandon arrangements under which they agree not to compete against each other on price and share flights on routes between major cities on a 50-50 basis.     Last July, it wrote to 10 major airlines saying their practices breach EC competition rules and demanding undertakings that they would be revised or abolished.     The Commission said in a statement today seven airlines have responded positively to these letters and negotiations are taking place on how their practices might be modified.  Reuter &#3;
