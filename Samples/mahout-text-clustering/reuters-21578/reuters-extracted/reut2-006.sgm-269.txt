SENATE BUDGET GROUP SHELVES REAGAN ECONOMIC DATA

The Senate Budget Committee, at its first budget drafting meeting of the year, discarded President Reagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budget would show a 108 billion dlr deficit.     In its place, the committee agreed to accept the non partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic assumptions in its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget.     The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adopted without change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1988 and thereby miss the Gramm-Rudman budget law target of 108 billion dlrs.
