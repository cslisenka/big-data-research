GLAXO <GLX> STOCK OFF ON ULCER REPORT

Shares of Glaxo Holdings PLC fell following a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine that antibiotics may be able to treat ulcers, threatening  Glaxo's billion dlr antiulcer drug Zantac, analysts said.     Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of 1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman <SKB>, maker of the popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.     "Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely new therapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwide business, which is Zantac," said David MacCallum, an analyst who follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.         Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annual sales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pct of Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.     "If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapy of choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline," said Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing and Or'kshnk.     Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by a University of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71 children with gastric disease that bacteria could cause gastritis and ulcers.         In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal, Richard Hornick of the University of Rochester School of Medicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers. Rizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcer relationship is "exciting and intriguing," but further studies are needed to show a direct causal effect.     Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodes and is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknown what actually causes the process.     It is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and therefore antacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagamet and Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the release of the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acid secretion.     "I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo," said analyst Rizopuolos. "It will take a long time to displace Tagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed by physicians for a long time," she added.      Reuter &#3;
