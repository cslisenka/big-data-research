BROKERS SAY NYSE RULE SHIFT LIMITS FLEXIBILITY

Officials of major brokerage firms expressed dismay at a New York Stock Exchange decision to force strict compliance with a rule barring members from trading in NYSE-listed issues in London during New York trading hours.     Most major brokerage houses said they had seen no formal notice from the NYSE on the interpretation of rule 390. Officials of the NYSE were unavailable to explain the timing or the technical details of enforcement of rule 390.     "It's a step backward," said Samuel Hunter, senior vice president for equity trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,     Hunter said any perceived problems caused by overlapping trading ought to be addressed by a search for equitable solutions instead of "hiding behind legalistic and technical definitions."     The NYSE evidently feels some traders use London to circumvent rules preventing short sales on minus ticks, Hunter said. But he believes simultaneous printing of trades in London and New York would be a way to have dual trading with an element of fairness. "I'm a great advocate of the view that the greater the volume, the better the market will be," he said.  Reuter &#3;
