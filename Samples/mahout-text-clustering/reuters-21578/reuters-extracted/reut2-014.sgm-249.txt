LONDON GOLD CLOSES OFF LOWS

Gold bullion ended the day easier but off lows after strengthening during late afternoon trading in sympathy with firmer values on Comex, dealers said.     The metal closed at 420.00/420.50 dlrs an ounce, up on the afternoon fix of 418.50, but still below last night's close of 421.50/422.     It eased during the morning as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio, buying cheaper silver and selling gold. Trading was quiet with interest in silver far outweighing gold.     Gold was at its high for the day at the opening and slipped to its low at the afternoon fix.     Platinum ended the day at 565.50/566.50 dlrs an ounce little changed from the afternoon fix of 566.35 or the morning setting of 565.75, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;
