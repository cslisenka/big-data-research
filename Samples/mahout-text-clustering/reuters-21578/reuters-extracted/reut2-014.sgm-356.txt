DOLLAR STEADY IN EUROPE AHEAD OF WASHINGTON TALKS

The dollar was steady ahead of a series of meetings of leading finance ministers starting today in Washington, despite low expectations for the outcome of the talks and still negative underlying sentiment toward the dollar.     "There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and the rest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said one U.K. Merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.     However, dealers said position squaring helped push the dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening 1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.     Meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinion poll findings of further strong support for the Conservative Party, but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying.     Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had needed to sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets so quiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds yesterday.     Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index, unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's finish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23 and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks, against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.     Traders said there was little hope that the Western financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of currency instability during the current series of talks in Washington.     These are scheduled to start today with an informal Group of Five (G-5) session.     Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada - is seen as the key meeting.     Traders said few operators will be prepared to open positions ahead of news emerging from the talks.     However, some traders said that, given the low level of expectations, the market could be particularly susceptible to signs of accord between the U.S. And Japan, which would give the dollar a sharp upward push.     They said interest is still largely centred on the yen, with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market first.     Meanwhile, today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the market. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon, but there was little followthrough, traders said.     The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening 145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10.     It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, against the start of 1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700 French francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending yesterday at 6.0660/710.
