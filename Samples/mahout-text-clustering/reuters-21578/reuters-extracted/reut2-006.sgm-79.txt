NYSE TO REVIEW PROGRAM TRADING

The New York Stock Exchange said it will review the long-term effects on securities markets of computer-driven trading techniques known as program trading.     The NYSE said, "The study will review major new trading techniques involving programmed portfolio hedging and index arbitrage for their potential benefits and risks to the financial system.     "It will also explore the regulatory implications of these trading techniques and whether their increased use could possibly lead to market abuse."     The exchange said a final report is expected before the end of 1987. It said program trading is becoming increasingly important as a market factor.  Reuter &#3;
