JUDGE DENIES DISMISSAL OF HUNT LOAN CHALLENGE

A federal judge has denied motions by several banks for summary dismissal of lawsuits challenging the loans they made to the Hunt brothers' two energy companies.     Nelson Bunker, W. Herbert and Lamar Hunt sued the 23 banks last year for 13.8 billion dlrs in damages after halting payment to the banks on 1.5 billon dlrs in overdue loans to <Placid Oil Co> and <Penrod Drilling Co>.     The ruling announced Thursday by Judge Barefoot Sanders clears the way for the Hunts to examine documents and interview officers at the banks seeking evidence to support their charges of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and interfering with the companies ability to pay back the loans.     Judge Sanders also rejected parts of the Unts' suit, including allegations the banks were trying to monopolize the drilling-rig business.     He reserved judgment on other Placid and Penrod complaints, including charges the banks acted in bad faith on the loans.  Reuter &#3;
