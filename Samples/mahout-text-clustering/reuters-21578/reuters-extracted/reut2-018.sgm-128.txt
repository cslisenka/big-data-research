AZT SUPRESSES DISEASES BESIDES AIDS, RESEARCHERS

Scientists reported that AZT, a compound found useful in fighting AIDS, can also suppress a wide range of diseases, including certain types of leukemia.       A paper on AZT, presented at the Third International Conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome by Cancer Institute researcher Hiroaki Mitsuya, said, "we now report that the dideoxynucleosides, including AZT, can suppress a wide range of human and animal retroviruses in vitro (in test tubes)."      Among those he cited were human T-cell leukemia virus-I which causes a number of diseases including leukemia, immunodeficiencies and neuorological disorders. AIDS is caused by a retrovirus.     AZT is made by Burroughs Wellcome Co, the U.S. subsidiary of the British Wellcome Plc <WELL.L>.     Mitsuya is a member of a team of American and Japanese researchers at the National Cancer Institute that made the original discovery last year that AZT prolonged the life of dying AIDS patients.
