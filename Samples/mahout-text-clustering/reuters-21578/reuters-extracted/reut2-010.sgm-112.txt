UAW CONFIRMS TALKS AT GM <GM> PLANT TO RESUME

The United Auto Workers confirmed an earlier company statement that contract talks between striking workers at a General Motors Corp's Michigan plant and the union will resume at 1000 EST tomorrow.     A UAW spokesman, in confirming a GM statement that talks will restart, said it "remains to be seen whether the talks will be successful."     The union, in a statement, said it was unable to reach a comprehensive settlement with GM on the issue of the company's subcontracting work to non-union labor, although tentative agreement was reached "on many matters." A UAW spokesman would not discuss the issues involved.     The union's 9,000 workers walked off the job at GM's Pontiac, Mich., truck and bus works earlier today.  Reuter &#3;
