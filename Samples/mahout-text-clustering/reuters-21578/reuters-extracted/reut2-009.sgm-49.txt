NASD TO BEGIN SEARCH FOR NEW PRESIDENT

The National Association of Securities Dealers, which will launch a search for a new president later this week, will probably concentrate on candidates with an extensive background in the financial markets, officials of the organization said today.     Gordon Macklin, 58, who has served as president for 17 years, today announced his decision to leave the organization of 6,658 broker-dealers. Macklin will join Hambrecht and Quist as chairman and co-chief executive officer.     Association chairman Joseph Hardiman will appoint a search committee later this week.     The committee will have its first meeting as early as next week. The new president is expected to be someone knowledgable about the over-the-counter markets and committed to the concept of self-regulation.     Macklin joined the association as president in 1970, leaving a position at McDonald and Co.     The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System, which currently lists 5200 securities of 4400 companies, was ushered in 10 months after Macklin's arrival.  Reuter &#3;
