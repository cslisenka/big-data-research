LONDON MONEY MARKET CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED

Money market interest rates closed little changed after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K. Base lending rates fizzled out, dealers said.     Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party well ahead had little effect on the market with operators looking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling continued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Washington this week.     One senior money broker commented, "What we want is an election date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the market knows what's happening then we can move forward."     The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10 pct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date of a general election is making for cautious trading, dealers said.     Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set to retain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and fuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates.     The British authorities are likely to remain cautious, however, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review their February Paris accord on currency stability. This could affect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in trade weighted terms to stand at 72.3.     Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the day-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of England. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, which have a maturity of between two and three months were transacted. Today, however, these again appeared but the majority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to two months range.     The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged quoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until fresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say they expect the market to continue around these levels with only technical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates.     The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the system today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite this, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range having started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct.     Period interbank rates were little changed with six months quoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct.     Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine months ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct respectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from late yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three months at 9-17/32 15/32 pct.  REUTER &#3;
