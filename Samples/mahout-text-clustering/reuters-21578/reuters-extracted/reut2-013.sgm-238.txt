PHILIPPINES APPROVES 80 MLN DLR DEBT CONVERSION

The Central Bank has approved the conversion of 80.7 mln dlrs worth of Philippine debt into equity in local projects under a debt-to-equity swap program started last August, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said.     He told reporters the amount represented 57 transactions involving diversified investments. He said 90 applications to convert 316.7 mln dlrs of debt have so far been received by the Central Bank.     Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC), a World Bank affiliate, would invest up to 12.5 mln dlrs in the First Philippine Capital Fund.     The fund, to be launched jointly by New York investment house Shearson Lehman Brothers and IFC, was proposed by Ongpin during a trip to the United States in September.     There was still no word on when the fund, designed to encourage private sector investment in the Philippines, would be launched.     A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will consist of exchanging up to 12.5 mln dlrs face value of Philippine debt it holds.     The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion plan are both aimed at reducing the country's debt burden by enabling interested investors to buy government notes at a discount, repatriate these and convert them at full value in pesos.     The proceeds will then be used to investing in local projects.     The country's foreign debt now stands at 27.8 billion dlrs.  REUTER &#3;
