CBT HITS CFTC'S FOREIGN FUTURES PROPOSALS

Proposed federal regulations governing the sale of foreign futures and options contracts to U.S. citizens would strap U.S. exchanges, an official of the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, said.     Frederick Grede, CBT vice president of administration and planning, told the Futures Industry Association that rules proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, would "handicap the ability of U.S. exchanges and futures commission merchants to compete internationally."     The CFTC rules generally would require additional registration and disclosure.     Grede said that speculative positions, hedging and aggregation do not exist on most overseas exchanges, and that the regulations would impose onerous requirements relating to the segregation of customer funds.     CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips, acknowledging that the proposal was "controversial," said the commission would consider revising the proposals.               Reuter &#3;
