Some 60 pct of 6,300 employees at Spain's 27 major ports have supported a strike since Monday in support of wage negotiations, a spokesman for the Public Works Ministry said.     He said, however, that the stoppage has had no effect in Barcelona, Bilbao, Las Palmas and Pasajes and that mandatory minimum services in other ports allowed perishable goods to be handled.
