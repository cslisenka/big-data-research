GATT SETS UP PANEL ON CANADIAN HERRING, SALMON

The ruling GATT Council today set up a formal dispute panel to examine a U.S. complaint that a Canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory.     David Wood, official spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row.     U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.     Robert White, Canada's deputy chief of delegation, replied the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel.  Reuter &#3;
