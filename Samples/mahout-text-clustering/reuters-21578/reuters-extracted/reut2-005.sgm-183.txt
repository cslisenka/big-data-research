SAUDI ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IMPROVED, MINISTER SAYS

Saudi Arabia's economy is showing signs of picking up after problems last year caused by the steep fall in oil prices, Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim said.     Salim told a conference of Saudi businessmen the government had taken a bold step to stimulate the economy by drawing down more than 50 billion riyals of reserves in its 1987 budget.     Salim said one tangible sign of that optimism had been a strong rise in the price of Saudi shares. Some have gained by more than 35 pct since last November.     But the keynote speaker, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, accused Saudi businessmen of ingratitude because they preferred to invest abroad rather than in Saudi Arabia.     The need to increase private investment in Saudi Arabia is expected to be a major theme of the conference.     Saudi Arabia's economic planners have long recognised the need to stimulate the private sector and diversify the oil-dependent economy.     But despite the encouraging signals cited by Salim, some businessmen and bankers said they are still sceptical about prospects for the economy.  REUTER &#3;
