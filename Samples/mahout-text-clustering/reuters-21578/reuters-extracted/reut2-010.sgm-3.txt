KEY U.S. HOUSE MEMBER OPPOSES CFTC USER PLAN

A key U.S. House member said he opposed a Reagan administration plan to shift the cost of surveillance of futures exchanges to the private sector.     "I just think user fees are the wrong way to attack a problem of this sort," said Rep. Ed Jones (D-Tenn.), chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.     The White House budget office has asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to draw up a plan for transferring the three-mln dlr cost of monitoring futures trading to either exchanges, futures commission merchants or users of the markets.     CFTC Commissioner William Seale said the proposal was a move in the wrong direction. "I would prefer to see (surveillance) paid for through the appropriations process rather than through taxation of market participants," he said.     CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips told the panel the commission was preparing the proposal, due to be completed April 15, at the request of the Office of Management and Budget.  Reuter &#3;
