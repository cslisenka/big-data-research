MERIDIAN <KITS> LICENSES PARASITE TEST KIT

Meridian Diagnostics Inc said it finalized a licensing agreement with the University of Arizona for the production of a test kit that detects Giardia lamblia, a major cause of traveler's diarrhea.     Giardia is a common parasite found in water and Meridian said it is the most common parasite in the U.S. It said it expects to release the product to the hospital market in late 1987.     It also said new government regulations indicate a significant need for a product to screen public water surplies for this parasite.  Reuter &#3;
