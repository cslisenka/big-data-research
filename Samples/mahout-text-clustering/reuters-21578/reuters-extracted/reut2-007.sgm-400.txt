LATIN POLICY ADJUSTMENT URGED BY CEA'S SPRINKEL

Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel called on Latin American governments to adopt sounder economic policies and said U.S. banks' loans to those countries had already been written down in an economic sense.     "Latin governments will have to adopt policies that promote growth for their own citizens," he said, adding that the record has been mixed.     Brazil, he said, recently has backtracked from better economic policies and "obviously they have to change."     Asked if U.S. banks ultimately would be forced to write down portions of their loans to Latin America, Sprinkel said, "In any realistic sense, economic sense, those loans have been written down."     The banks could not sell the loans at par, he said, and the price/earnings ratio of major banks' stocks has not been doing very well.     "Clearly the lenders have suffered," said Sprinkel.
