SOVIET CORN CARGO REJECTED, RELOADING AT CHICAGO

A cargo of U.S. corn for the Soviet Union was rejected and forced to be unloaded at a Chicago export elevator earlier this week after it failed to make grade, with the British vessel Broompark now being reloaded, an elevator spokesman said.     The first attempt to load the ship failed when the percentage of broken kernels proved to be higher than contract specifications, he said.     The Soviets traditionally refuse to take sub-grade grain at a price discount, as is the practice with many other importing nations, he added.     The official estimated the reloading of the vessel with about 700,000 tonnes of corn may be completed by Tuesday, April 28.  Reuter &#3;
