MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE THREE FRENCH BANKS

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade the top-flight Aaa ratings of Societe Generale, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais.     The rating agency cited the ongoing deregulation of the French banking industry and financial markets. Moody's said it anticipates increasing competition and reduced profitability of the banks' core businesses.     The senior debt and certificates of deposit of the three banks are rated Aaa. However, their Prime-1 commercial paper ratings are not under review. Issues supported by long-term letters of credit of the banks may also be affected.  Reuter &#3;
