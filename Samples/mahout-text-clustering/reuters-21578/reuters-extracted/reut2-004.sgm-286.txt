HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE POSTPONES FSLIC ACTION

The financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee postponed indefinitely a session to draft legislation on the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, FSLIC.     The mark-up session was postponed after Democrats on the subcommittee failed in a caucus to agree on several issues, including the size of a financial rescue package for FSLIC, a committee staff member said.     On Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee passed a bill to recapitalize FSLIC at 7.5 billion dlrs over two years.  Reuter &#3;
