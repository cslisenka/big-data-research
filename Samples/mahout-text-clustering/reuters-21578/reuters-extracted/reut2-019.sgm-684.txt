CHRYSLER <C> REPORTED TO BE IN TALKS WITH CHINA

Chrysler Corp is negotiating with the Chinese Government owned First Autoworks about a project in which the Dodge 600 mid-sized car could be added to the Chinese firm's lineup, the trade paper Automotive News said.     It said Chrysler is discussing the supply of 2.2 liter four-cylinder engines as well as tooling for the 600, which has been on the U.S. market since 1982.     Chrysler spokesmen were not available for comment today. But the trade paper quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying Chrysler is competing with French-based Citroen and an unnamed Japanese maker to supply First Autoworks.  Reuter &#3;
