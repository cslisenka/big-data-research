CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SAY ROME GOVERNMENT FINISHED

Italy's majority Christian Democrat party, saying the five-party government to which it belongs is finished, has decided to withdraw its 16 ministers before a parliamentary confidence vote later this week.     Christian Democrat leadership issued a document saying it "registers ... The dissolution of the present government."     Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's five-party government resigned on March 3 after a dispute between his party and the Christian Democrats. President Francesco Cossiga has rejected the resignation and sent the government back to parliament for a confidence debate.  REUTER &#3;
