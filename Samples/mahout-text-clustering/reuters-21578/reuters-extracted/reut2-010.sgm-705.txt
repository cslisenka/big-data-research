WESTPAC CALLS FOR CUT IN AUSTRALIAN BUDGET DEFICIT

A maximum budget deficit of 2.5 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987/88 ending June 30 is needed if financial markets are to be impressed with the government's resolve to tackle Australia's economic problems, Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> said.     This compares with the budgeted deficit of 3.5 billion dlrs for the current 1986/87 year although the market expects the actual shortfall to be some 500 mln dlrs higher.     In its latest Economic Review, Westpac said powerful arguments could be advanced for eliminating the deficit altogether next year or even budgeting for a modest surplus.     Westpac said such a policy would deliver the message the government was determined to face deep-seated economic problems. But it said it would be a great deal to expect of a government in what was probably an election year.     It said even a relatively minor cut in the deficit would require some unpleasant decisions, noting a repeat of the 1986/87 budget's zero real growth in spending would only bring the deficit to about 4.3 billion dlrs.     A cut of greater than two pct in real terms was needed if a 2.5 billion dlr deficit was to be achieved and this required some radical surgery to existing programs, the bank said.     Westpac said the government's mid-May mini-budget provided an opportunity for bold measures, both in relation to the size of the government's role in the economy and the principles governing that activity, notably indexation of outlays.     It said official figures show 93 pct of outlays in some way indexed, hard to justify when living standards outside the public sector were being eroded.     In current circumstances, the alternative to fiscal discipline is the sure road to bigger external debts, further currency depreciation, a boost to inflation and, ultimately, capital flight, the bank said.
