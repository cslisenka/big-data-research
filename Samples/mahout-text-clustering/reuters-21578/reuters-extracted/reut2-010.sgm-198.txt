COSTA RICAN CENTRAL BANK CHIEF RESIGNS

Eduardo Lizano, president of Costa Rica's central bank and the country's chief debt negotiator, has tendered his resignation and will be leaving the government next month, a central bank spokesman said.     The spokesman said Lizano, 56, announced his decision to leave the bank late yesterday during a meeting of its board of directors. "He intends to dedicate himself to teaching at the university of costa rica," he said.     Lizano could not be reached immediately for comment on his decision to leave the central bank.     Well-placed sources said his departure follows months of bitter infighting over government economic policy and the handling of this nation's foreign debt, which is among the highest per capita in the world.
