AMOCO <AN> CANADA OFFER TO TOP ONE BILLION DLRS

The public stock offering Amoco Canada plans if it succeeds in its 5.2 billion-dlr takeover of Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP> will be worth more than one billion Canadian dlrs, a published report said.     Public stockholders would own at least 15 pct of Amoco Canada, although Amoco plans to raise the level of Canadian participation higher than that, Amoco Canada president Donald Stacy said in an interview in the Toronto Star.     Stacy would not say how much higher, adding that that question will be the subject of discussions between Amoco and Investment Canada, the federal agency which reviews foreign takeovers of Canadian companies, the newspaper said.         Amoco Canada plans to make its submission to the agency next Thursday.     Stacy said the issue would be sold in stages and that the first stage would be worth 200 mln to 300 mln Canadian dlrs, the Star said. The initial offering would not take place until at least one year after Amoco acquired Dome, to allow the two operations to merge.  Reuter &#3;
