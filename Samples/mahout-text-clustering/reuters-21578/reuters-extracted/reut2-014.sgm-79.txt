HIGHWOOD <HIWDF> COMMENTS ON SHARE PRICE RISE

Highwood Resources Ltd said it is not aware of any material change in the company's affairs to account for recent trading activity in the company's shares, but said it anticipates being a future producer of minerals used in electronic superconductors.     Recent widespread publicity concerning superconductors suggest a greatly increased demand for yttrium and lanthanide minerals, Highwood said.     The company said it is developing such deposits at Thor Lake, Northwest Territories in cooperation with Hecla Mining Co, of Idaho.     Highwood Resources said the deposits contain beryllium, yttrium, lanthanides, niobium and tantalum. It did not immediately elaborate on estimated reserves on the property.     Highwood shares traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 6-7/8, up 1/8, after climbing 1-1/8 in yesterday's session.  Reuter &#3;
