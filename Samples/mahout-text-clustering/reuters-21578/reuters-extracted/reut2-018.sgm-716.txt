U.S. SAYS IT WON'T YIELD IN JOURNALIST'S KIDNAPPING

The United States, responding to the kidnapping of American journalist Charles Glass, today insisted it would not yield to terrorist blackmail.     "While much remains unclear, we assume this is another terrorist attempt to manipulate the United States through our concern for our citizens," the State Department said in a statement.     "While we are deeply concerned for the well-being of Mr. Glass, Mr. (Ali) Usayran and all hostages, American and foreign, and extend our sympathy to their families and friends, we repeat that we will not yield to terrorist blackmail," it said.     The State Department said its embassy in Beirut had learned that Glass, a journalist on leave from his job with ABC television, and Usayran, the son of the Lebanese defense minister, were kidnapped on the Awaz'i Road in the southern suburbs of Beirut north of Beirut International Airport on June 17.     "We know of no claims of responsibility," the department said.     "We hold the kidnappers responsible for the safety of their victims and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those held hostages," it added.  Reuter &#3;
