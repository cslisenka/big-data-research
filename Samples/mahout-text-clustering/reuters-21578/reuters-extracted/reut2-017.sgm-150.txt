GLENMEDE TRUST TO SELL PART OF SUN <SUN> STOCK

<Glenmede Trust Co> and Sun Co said that Glenmede plans to sell a portion of its charitable holdings of Sun common stock, of which it holds 28 pct of the outstanding shares.     They said the sales, to be made in the market subject to prevailing market conditions, will not exceed 2.5 pct of Sun's 107.7 mln outstanding common shares.     Glenmede, a trustee for various trusts and estates, said the sales are part of an ongoing plan to maintain its Sun holdings at levels roughly equal to those prior to the Sun stock buyback program that began in 1980.
