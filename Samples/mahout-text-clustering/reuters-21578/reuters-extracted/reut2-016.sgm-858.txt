SONY PLANS VIDEO AND TAPE PRODUCTION IN THAILAND

<Sony Corp> of Japan plans to launch a 15-mln-dlr project here soon to produce video and music cassette tapes mainly for export, Chira Phanupong, head of Thailand's Board of Investment, said.     Chira told reporters Sony will likely receive investment tax incentives from his agency which is in charge of promoting foreign investment.     The BoI chief said most small and medium Japanese firms view Thailand as the best country in South East Asia to which they could shift their high-cost production facilities in the wake of the strong yen.     BoI officials said the number of new Japanese investment projects seeking promotional privileges from the Thai government increased substantially in the past year as the stronge yen forced more Japanese companies to look for cheaper production bases abroad.     <Sharp Corp> recently also obtained BoI tax incentives to invest in a project here to produce microwave ovens and refrigerators for the Thai market and for export.     Chira said a big Japanese electronic firm is negotiating with his agency for Thai tax incentives for its project to manufacture audio equipment and other electrical appliances here.     He declined to name the Japanese company but said its proposed project will provide employment for 50,000 Thais in five years.                REUTER &#3;
