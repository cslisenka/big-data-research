WALL STREET AT RECORD IN BIGGEST ONE DAY GAIN

Wall Street scored its biggest one session gain ever, climbing to a record in extremely active trading. A strong bond market, triggering arbitrage related buy programs and drawing many short sellers in to even up positions, propelled stocks sharply higher.     "This was a startling performance in a week that began with a nervous selloff and growing anxiety about inflation, interest rates and trade friction," Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 70 points to 2390. Outdistancing the previous one day record gain of 54 points set on February 17.  Reuter &#3;
