LME ZINC CLOSES STEADY AT LOWER LEVELS

LME zinc after lunch held steady around lower morning levels as some light buying emerged around the 730 dlrs equivalent level, dealers said. This saw three months delivery end afternoon ring dealings at 456 stg, down one stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close, and the dollar equivalent ended around 733 dlrs, down one.     In the morning, light trade selling in a thin market had taken three months down to 730 but failed to attract any follow through selling.  REUTER &#3;
