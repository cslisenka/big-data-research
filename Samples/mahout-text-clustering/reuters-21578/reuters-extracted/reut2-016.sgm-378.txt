SWIFT TO SELL SOUTH DAKOTA PORK PLANT

Swift Independent Packing Co said it agreed in principle to sell its Huron, South Dakota, pork plant to Huron Dressed Beef, for undisclosed terms.     Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to Huron's ability to hire an experienced work force at competitive rates, and receive government approval of the purchase and operation of the plant, Swift said.
