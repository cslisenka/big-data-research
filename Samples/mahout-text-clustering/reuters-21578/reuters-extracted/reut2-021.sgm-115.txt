NYSE SAYS IT IS CONFIDENT IT CAN HANDLE VOLUME

The New York Stock Exchange said it is confident that its computer systems can handle the pace of trading volume today.     "We are confident that whatever volume we have this afternoon, we can handle it," said Richard Torrenzano, a vice president at the NYSE.     With two hours of trading left, a record 422 mln shares have traded hands, far outpacing the volume on the market's busiet days. The previous busiest day was last Friday, when 338 mln shares traded.     "Our systems have been tested and they can handle heavy volume effectiviy and efficiently," Torrenzano said.     He said the Exchange has been in constant contact with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning today's record breaking decline and heavy volume. He declined to comment on the context of those discussions.     Earlier today, SEC chairman David Ruder said a brief trading halt has been discussed as one way of restoring order to the market, but stressed he is not recommending one at this time. He did not say if the option was discussed with the NYSE.  Reuter &#3;
