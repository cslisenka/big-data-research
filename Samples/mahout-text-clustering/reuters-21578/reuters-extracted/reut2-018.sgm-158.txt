UAW CHIEF DISPLEASED WITH GREENSPAN APPOINTMENT

United Automobile Workers union president Owen Bieber said he was pleased Paul Volcker is leaving as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board but not encouraged at Alan Greenspan's nomination to succeed him.     "When you say Greenspan in now in view, that troubles me," the UAW leader told reporters at a news conference.     Bieber, whose union has 1.1 mln members, said that with Greenspan heading the Fed, "I'm afraid it means a continuation of the same policies we've been on, which I don't think are the right policies."
