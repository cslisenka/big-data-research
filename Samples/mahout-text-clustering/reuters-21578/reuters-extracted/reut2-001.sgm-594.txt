NATIONAL HEALTHCARE <NHCI> GETS DEFAULT WAIVERS

National Healthcare Inc said it has received a waiver until May 26 of its technical defaults under covenants of its bank credit agreement.     The company said that under an amendment to the credit agreement, its line of credit has been cut to 125 mln dlrs due to reduced requirements for acquisition financing, interest on all borrowings has been increased and National Healthcare has agreed to provide additional collateral.     It said the banks have advanced it another six mln dlrs for working capital, bringing the total borrowed against the line to about 120 mln dlrs.     National Healthcare said that during the waiver period it intends to seek more permanent modifications to covenants of the bank credit agreement.  Reuter &#3;
