AMERICAN CAN <AC> TO CHANGE NAME

American Can Co said it plans to change its name to Primerica Corp, subject to approval by shareholders at the April 28 annual meeting.     It said its new New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol would be <PA>.     American Can sold all its packaging operations -- and rights to the American Can name -- to Triangle Industries Inc <TRI> in November.     The company said the new name gives it flexibility as it moves into new areas of enterprise.  American Can is now involved in financial services and specialty retailing.  Reuter &#3;
