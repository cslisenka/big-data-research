JAPAN TRUCK MAKERS TO CURB EXPORTS TO NORTH KOREA

All four Japanese makers of large trucks will stop exports to North Korea following the issue of Japanese government guidance, company spokesmen told Reuters.     The move responds to the U.S. Government's expression of concern that North Korea was using Japanese-made trucks as missile launching pads, they said.     <Nissan Diesel Motor Co Ltd> shipped 156 vehicles including large and mid-sized trucks and buses to North Korea in 1986 while Isuzu Motors Ltd <ISUM.T> exported more than 100 six to eight-tonne trucks in 1986, company spokesmen said.     A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> said it had almost no trade with North Korea last year.     <Hino Motors Ltd> shipped 28 five-tonne trucks in 1986, a company spokesman said.
