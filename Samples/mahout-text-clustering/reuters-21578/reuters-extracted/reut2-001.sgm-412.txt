REAGAN NOMINATES FBI DIRECTOR TO HEAD CIA

President Reagan nominated Federal Bureau of Investigation Director William Webster to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in succession to ailing William Casey.     The announcement came one day after Reagan withdrew the nomination of Deputy CIA Dirctor Robert Gates, who faced opposition in the Senate because of the CIA's role in the Iran-contra scandal.     "Bill Webster will bring a remarkable depth and breadth of experience as well as a remarkable record of achievement to this position," said Reagan in a statement read by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
