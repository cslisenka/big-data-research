CENTRAL MAINE <CTP> SEEKS COGENERATOR SPONSORS

Central Maine Power Co said it issued a request for proposals for about 150 potential project sponsors of cogeneration and small power production projects.     The utility said it has about filled six avoided cost decrements and is soliciting proposals to fill about 50 megawatts each in the seventh and eighth decrements as defined by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.     Central Main said the avoided costs for both decrements have been established on the basis of costs negotiated between the utility and Hydro-Quebec for planned power purchase beginning in 1992.
