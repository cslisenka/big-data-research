DIAPULSE OF AMERICA CLEARED TO MARKET DEVICE

<Diapulse Corp of America> said it has received permission to resume marketing its Diapulse pulsed high peak power electromagnetic energy medical device for treatment of postoperative edema and pain in superficial soft tissues.     The company said it had been enjoined from marketing the product in the U.S. since 1972 due to a labeling impasse with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.     It said the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York modified an injunction against sale of the product following a motion filed jointly by the company and the FDA.  Reuter &#3;
