SOUTHWESTERN <SBC> OPPOSES BAN ON SERVICES

Southwestern Bell Corp said it opposes the Department of Justice recommendation that regional holding companies be banned from offering interexchange services within their regions.     Southwestern Bell said state regulators should decide whether regional holding companies are allowed to provide the service, according to a brief filed in U.S. district court in Washington outlining the company's position.     The company contends there is little likelihood competition would be hampered, according to the brief.      Southwestern Bell supports the Justice Department's recommendation to lift bans on information services and equipment manufacturing, and to allow regional holding companies to enter non-telecommunications businesses, it said.
