COLOMBIA'S TEXACO <TX> OPERATIONS NOT AFFECTED

The operations in Colombia of Texas Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Texaco Inc, will not be affected by the legal dispute with the Pennzoil Co, its manager John Buttle said in a communique.     The company yesterday filed protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code. He said Texaco Inc did not operate outside the United States and operations of Texas Petroleum here are unaffected.     Texas Petroleum Co, which posted a seven mln dlr profit in 1986 in Colombia, exploits in association with state-run oil company Ecopetrol some crude and natural gas wells.      Reuter &#3;
