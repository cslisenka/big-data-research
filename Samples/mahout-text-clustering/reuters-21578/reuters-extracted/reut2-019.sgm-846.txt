ALLIS-CHALMERS <AH> DEBT, PAPER CUT BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service said it downgraded 95 mln dlrs of outstanding Allis-Chalmers Corp issues. It lowered the sinking fund debentures to Ca from B-3 and the Series C preferred stock to Ca from Caa.     Moody's cited as justification the company's filing for court protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Also, the agency noted the company's inability to restructure its debt obligations.     Allis-Chalmers Corp is a manufacturer of air quality control, fluids handling and solid materials processing equipment.  Reuter &#3;
