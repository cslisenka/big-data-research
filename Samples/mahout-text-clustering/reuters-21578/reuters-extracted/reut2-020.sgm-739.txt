HERCULES <HPC> SEES DOUBLING IN UNIT'S SALES

Hercules Inc said its contract award from Martin Marietta Corp <ML> to make upgraded solid rocket motors for the Titan Four launch vehicle will help double revenues at its Hercules Aerospace Co unit to two billion dlrs by 1992.     "We expect and we are fully confident that by 1992 we will be a two billion dlr a year sales company. The space booster program is a substantial part of that," Hercules Aerospace head E.J. Sheehy told Reuters.     Hercules Inc, which also produces specialty chemicals and engineered polymers, had sales of 2.62 billion dlrs in 1986.     The company said the initial and still unnegotatiated contract for development and production of 15 sets of solid rocket boosters for the Titan space vehicles is expected to exceed 500 mln dlrs.     Sheehy also said, "It is obvious that if this program goes as everyone anticipates, that there will be substantial production follow-on."     He declined to specify the possible value of future related contracts.     Hercules Aerospace will spend about 100 mln dlrs to reach full production levels, Sheehy said.     Hercules Inc said the money was available from Hercules' recent 1.49 billion dlr sale of its 38.5 pct stake in Himont Inc <HMT> to Montedison S.p.A. <MONI.MI>.  Reuter &#3;
