FRENCH TREASURY DETAILS PLANNED TAP ISSUE

The French Treasury will issue between eight and 12 billion francs worth of tap stock depending on market conditions at its next monthly tender on Thursday, banking sources said.     The planned issue will be of two fixed rate tranches, of the 8.50 pct 1997 and the 8.50 pct 2002 stock, and one tranche of the 1999 variable-rate stock. The minimum amount of each tranche to be sold will be one billion francs.     At its last tender on March 4, the Bank of France sold 11.05 billion francs of tap stock.  REUTER &#3;
