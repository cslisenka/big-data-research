DOLLAR GENERAL <DOLR.O> MARCH SALES FALL

Dollar General Corp said sales for March fell 4.6 pct to 43.4 mln dlrs from 45.5 mln dlrs a year earlier, with same-store sales off 6.9 pct.     The company said in March 1986, sales were helped by Easter shopping and a heavier schedule of promotions. Easter falls April 19 this year, and the company said unseasonably cold and snowy weather hampered March results this year.     It said first quarter sales were up seven pct to 114.4 mln dlrs from 107.0 mln dlrs a year earlier.  Reuter &#3;
