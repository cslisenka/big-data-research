WEST GERMAN FARMERS MARCH AGAINST EC POLICIES

About 8,000 West German farmers marched through the northern city of Kiel today in a protest against European Community (EC) agricultural policies, organisers said.     The demonstrators burned straw effigies of the two West German members of the EC's 17-man Commission, Karl-Heinz Narjes and Alois Pfeiffer, and demanded their removal from office.     Speakers at a rally also called on the government to take a tougher stance in dealings with the Commission.     The protest was the latest of several by West German farmers against Commission proposals to cut EC farm spending.The farmers say the proposals will put many of them out of business.  Reuter &#3;
