CONDOM RECALLS RISE DUE TO FDA TESTING

The Food and Drug Administration said stepped up testing of condoms by the agency has led to a three recalls by U.S. manufacturers and the detention of foreign-made condoms at U.S. borders.     The FDA said industry standards require that roughly no more than four out of 1,000 condoms leak. Condoms are tested by pouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage.     The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls, N.J., has voluntarily recalled one lot of Sheik Fetherlite condoms, which was distributed to 22 accounts through the United States.         The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of the condoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time of the recall and are being recovered.     National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood, Ill, voluntarily recalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condoms which were distributed to a wholesaler in California and two retailers in Indiana and Michigan, the FDA said.     The FDA said National estimates that none of the suspect lot remains on the market. The FDA also said National recalled two more lots of condoms following additional FDA tests.     The FDA also said Circle Rubber Corp of Newark, N.J., is voluntarily recalling Saxon and L'appel condoms after being informed of FDA test results. The FDA said the condoms were distributed in North Carolina and Illinois.     The FDA urged condom makers on April 7 to inform consumers about how condoms should be used to increase protection against sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Since April, the FDA said it had detained 15 shipments of condoms made by firms in Korea and four shipments of condoms from Malaysia.  Reuter &#3;
