NY COFFEE FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER

N.Y. coffee futures closed higher again today on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.     In addition, roaster demand emerged in some forward deliveries, while earlier trade selling around the 102.50 cent level in the May retreated. May closed 2.21 cents higher at 104.25 cents, its highest close since March 30.     Analysts said the market has now fully discounted the fact that there most likely will not be fresh ICO coffee quota talks until September. "It's now starting to focus more on the day to day, a possibly oversold condition, and some roaster interest," one analyst said.     Estimated volume was 3,605 contracts.     July was up 2.25 cents at 106.25 cents.  Reuter &#3;
