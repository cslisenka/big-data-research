WINNIPEG OILSEED FUTURES END UP, GRAINS MIXED

Winnipeg oilseed futures closed higher in sympathy with strength in the Chicago soybean complex, with grains mixed in quiet trade.     Rapeseed futures ended with gains of 2.60 to 3.30 dlrs per tonne, with flaxseed up 4.90 to 4.00 dlrs. Commission house and commercial short-covering overcame moderate elevator house hedge selling in both oilseeds, traders said. Continued Japanese crusher export buying added support to rapeseed, with locals net buyers in flaxseed.     Rye finished unchanged to up 0.10 dlr, with feed grains ranging from down 0.60 dlr in May wheat to up 0.30 in new December barley. Strength in new crop Chicago corn futures kept deferreds here strong relative to nearbys. May and July oats again set new contract lows.  Reuter &#3;
