NORTH AMERICAN VENTURES <NAVI.O> SELLS COMMON

North American Ventures Inc said it has sold about nine mln dlrs of the company's restricted common shares to the newly created <Butler International Inc> Employee Stock Option Plan.     North American said the nine mln dlrs payment resulted from an excess of funds in Butler's pension plan.     The transaction was for about 1.5 mln North American common shares approximating 5.1 pct of the company's outstanding shares, North American said.         North American said proceeds from the stock sale would increase the company's stockholders' equity to about 85 mln dlrs and will be used to pay down aquisition financing used in the Butler purchase which was completed in January.
