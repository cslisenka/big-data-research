DISCRIMINATION CHARGES LIFTED AGAINST TWA <TWA>

Trans World Airlines Inc said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dismissed charges of sex and age discrimination filed against it by members of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants.     The union went on strike in March 1986 after failing to agree on a contract and charged that the airline sought greater wage concessions from the flight attendants because they were predominantly female.     TWA said the commission found that there is no reason to believe these allegations are true.  Reuter &#3;
