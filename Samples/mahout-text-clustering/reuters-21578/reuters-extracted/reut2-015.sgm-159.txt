ADVANCED MICRO <AMD> UNVEILS COMPUTER CHIPS

Advanced Micro Devices Inc said it is developing a set of five computer chips for use in digital communications systems.     The company said the new chips support the integrated services digital network, or ISDN, the international standard for digital voice and data communications.     Advanced Micro also said it has signed a licensing agreement with American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> under which ATT has provided it with certain digital communications specifications.     Today's announcement follows the company's introduction last week of a 32-bit microprocessor.     "We have now reached a key point in the development of communications devices that implement a worldwide ISDN standard," said John East, group vice president for Advanced Micro's logic businesses.     He said the company's new computer chips, to be available by the end of this year, should boost the acceptance and implementation of ISDN services.      The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unit quantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25 dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are already being sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp <INTC>, ATT, Rockwell International <ROK> and a joint venture between Northern Telecom LTd <NT> and Motorola Inc <MOT>.     The ISDN standard, portions of which are still being defined, will provide for the simultaneous transmission of voice, data and video.     Advanced Micro chip sets will be used in equipment such as private branch exchanges and desktop computers.     The company also said it is developing an ISDN protocol controller. It said the controller will connect directly with its current line of ISDN devices.     The device supports several digital communications protocols, including ones from International Business Machines Corp <IBM> and ATT.  Reuter &#3;
