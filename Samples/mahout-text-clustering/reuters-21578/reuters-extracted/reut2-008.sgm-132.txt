AUSTRALIAN OPPOSITION LEADER SACKS PREDECESSOR

Australian opposition leader John Howard sacked from the shadow cabinet Andrew Peacock, who is a former foreign minister and Howard's predecessor, party officials said.     The officials said the move could lead to the collapse of the opposition coalition between the Liberal and National parties, which has been under severe strain in recent weeks.     In a television interview yesterday prime minister Bob Hawke said he might call an early election if strife within the opposition undermined business confidence and hurt Australia's economic recovery.     "The opposition have not only destabilised themselves, they have prostituted the political and economic debate by putting up economic nostrums and stupidities that are destabilizing business confidence," Hawke said.     Howard relegated Peacock to the back benches after the Melbourne Sun published an alleged telephone conversation between Peacock and another opposition member in which Peacock was critical of Howard's leadership. The paper said the call was recorded by an unidentified man using an electronic radio scanner. In a statement Howard said the conversation was damaging to the party and implied disloyalty to him.     Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to "hire and fire." He refused to answer questions about any leadership challenge.     Liberal party officials said the move against Peacock could encourage his supporters to mount a challenge to Howard's leadership. Peacock was ousted as opposition leader by Howard in September 1985, after losing the 1984 general election to Hawke.     Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a veteran National Party member, recently campaigned against Howard's leadership and urged his party to split from the coalition.  REUTER &#3;
