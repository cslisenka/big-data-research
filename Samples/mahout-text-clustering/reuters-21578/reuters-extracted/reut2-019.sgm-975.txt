U.S. BANK BOARD TAKES OVER INSOLVENT THRIFT

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it closed down the insolvent United Federal Savings and Loan Association of Durant, Okla, and turned its insured deposits and other assets and liabilities over to a newly created, federally chartered thrift.     It said the failed thrift's four offices would reopen tomorrow under Bank Board management.     United, with assets of 9.31 mln dlrs, was closed because it had substantially dissipated its assets and earnings due to federal law violations and unsafe and unsound practices, the thrift regulatory agency said.     The Bank Board faulted the failed thrift for its large holdings of substandard loans made in 1984-85 due to "imprudent underwriting policies and controls on loans for construction and other purposes throughout the United States."     It also charged the thrift had violated federal rules governing conflicts of interest, loans to a single borrower and changes of control.     The thrift was the 27th federally insured savings and loan to be closed down by the bank board so far this year.  Reuter &#3;
