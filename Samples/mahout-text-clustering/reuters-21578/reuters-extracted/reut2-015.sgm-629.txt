MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE <AHI>

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade American Healthcare Management Inc's 80 mln dlrs of 15 pct subordinated notes.     Moody's review will focus on prospects for the company's operating earnings in view of moderately disappointing results in 1986, an increasingly difficult industry environment and the possible loss later this year of income from one of American Healthcare's most profitable hospitals.     The agency said American was unable to renew that hospital's lease. Moody's will also study the likelihood of American Healthcare reducing debt service requirements.  Reuter &#3;
