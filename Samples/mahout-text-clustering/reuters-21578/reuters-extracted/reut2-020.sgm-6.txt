JAPANESE PREMIER SAYS HE WATCHING STOCK SITUATION

Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.     "We must watch things a little longer. New York is down 22 pct, London 10 pct, while compared to this Japan is seven pct down," Kyodo quoted him as telling reporters.     Asked if he agreed with analysts who called the stock sell-off "Black Monday," Nakasone said: "Compared with times past, economics have changed completely." He rejected a comparison between the present situation and the stock market collapse of 1929 and the recession which followed.  REUTER &#3;
