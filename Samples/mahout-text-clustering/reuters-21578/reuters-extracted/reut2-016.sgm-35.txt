FRENCH PROPOSE NEW WORLD BANK DEBT FACILITY

The French government said it  proposed the creation of a new facility for development and for debt reduction under the framework of the World Bank.     In a statement issued in conjunction with the meeting of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee, the French said the "multilateral resources thus collected would permit a partial refinancing on highly concessional terms of previously rescheduled official debts."     The statement said the "French government believes it is necessary to take new steps to deal with the issue of the poorest countries' debt."     The French statement said that Paris club reschedulings should have a lengthening of the repayment period up to between 15 and 20 years instead of the current limit of 10 years.     And grace periods would be extended.     "These measures would be confined to the poorest, heavily indebted countries and would be decided on a case-by-case basis," it said.     The French also called for making the IMF's compensatory financing facility for export shortfalls more concessional.  Reuter &#3;
