REGAL <RGL>, BELL PETROLEUM IN REORGANIZATION

Regal International Inc said it proposed to submit a plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court under which it will acquire Bell Petroleum Services INc's by paying out all of its creditors and issue one share for each shares of Bell's stock.     This proposal has been amended from a previously rejected offer of .50 Regal share for each Bell share.     Regal said its will pursue the acquisition without the support of Bell's management.     Bell Petroleum filed its Chapter 11 petition in November 1986 and has not, as yet, filed a plan of reorganization but has only sought an order extending the exclusive order, according to Regal.     Bell Petroleum President Ed Runyan said the company is evaluating Regal's latest offer and evaluating other alternatives.     Runyan said Bell is meeting tomorrow with another potential suitor.
