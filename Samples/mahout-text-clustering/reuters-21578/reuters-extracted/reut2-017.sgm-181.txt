ENTWISTLE <ENTW.O> HAS 5.1 PCT OF ESPEY <ESP>

Entwistle Co told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired 62,500 shares of Espey Manufacturing and Electronics Corp, or 5.1 pct of the total outstanding common stock.     Entwistle, a Hudson, Mass., machinery maker and military contractor, said it bought the stake for investment purposes and has no plans to seek control of the company or to seek representation on its board of directors.     But Entwistle said it has indicated its interest to Espey management in acquiring a family-held 19 pct stake in the company in addition to its current stake.  Reuter &#3;
