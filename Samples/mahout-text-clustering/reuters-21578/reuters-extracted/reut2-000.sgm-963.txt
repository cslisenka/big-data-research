REAGAN APPROVAL RATING FALLS TO FOUR-YEAR LOW

President Reagan's approval rating fell after the Tower Commission criticised his handling of the Iran arms scandal, a New York Times/CBS poll indicates.     The poll found 51 pct of those surveyed thought he was lying when he said he did not remember if he had approved the original arms sales to Iran and 35 pct thought he was telling the truth.     The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved Reagan's handling of his job and 46 pct disapproved. The approval rating was the lowest since January 1983, when 41 pct approved of the way Reagan was doing his job.  REUTER &#3;
