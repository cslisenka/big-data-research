WORLD SUGAR FUTURES RALLY LATE, SETTLE HIGHER

World sugar futures settled higher, strengthening late on shortcovering and technically-based buying, analysts said.     The rally gained momentum "when traders realized they could get a key reversal," a commission house analyst said. But the market showed signs of continued resistance near 7.0 cents basis May, he noted.     May delivery exceeded yesterday's low and yesterday's high before settling at 6.94 cents a lb, up 0.15 cent.     Values tumbled this morning when computer fund selling triggered sell-stops at 6.60 cents and under. But contracts recouped most of those losses by midsession on trade buying, brokers said.     Estimated volume was 20,339 lots.  Reuter &#3;
