TRW <TRW> RESPONDS TO CHARGES BY EX-EMPLOYEE

TRW Inc, responding to allegations by an ex-employee that it was unethical in defense contract dealings, said it had previously informed the government of the billing problems.     "We heard nothing of substance as far as allegations by former employees that were not related to findings that we had reported to the government of misdeeds at our compressor components group," a TRW spokesman said.      The spokesman said the company conducted an internal investigation and presented the findings to the government beginning in late 1984.  Reuter &#3;
