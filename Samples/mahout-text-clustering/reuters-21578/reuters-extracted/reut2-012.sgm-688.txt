COLOMBIA COFFEE CHIEF WELCOMES BRAZIL MEASURES

Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's Coffee Growers' Federation, welcomed Brazil's export measures and said they clarified the market situation.     He told journalists the measures "set the rules clearly" and helped dissipate whatever doubts the market might have had about the world's biggest exporter's policies.     Brazil's coffee institute, IBC, today opened export registrations for May with no quantity limit set. The contribution quota will be 15 pct of the minimum registration price, which will vary daily.
