RESEARCHERS FIND PROMISING ANTI-AIDS AGENT

Peptide T, a minute chemical structure that can be easily manufactured, effectively blocks the attack of the deadly AIDS virus on human cells, researchers claimed.      The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health announced at the third annual International Conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome that Peptide T, first identified by institute neuro-scientist Dr. Candace Pert, "potently blocks entry of the AIDS virus into cells..."          The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has quickly approved clinical testing of the naturally-occurring brain chemical. The decision  makes possible tests on AIDS victims.       Dr. Frederick Goodwin, the institute's scientific director, said in a joint interview with Pert, that "my gut reaction is that we are onto something."       He said that based on initial findings Peptide T may hold more promise as a treatment for those already suffering from AIDS, but could also have some value in the search for a vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease.         A research team has found that Peptide T is capable of fully reversing brain cell damage caused by AIDS under a variety of laboratory tests.     Pert said that she sent doses of Peptide T last autumn to a Swedish doctor who provided the chemical to four AIDS patients. One died, but the three survivors showed some improvement, she said.         Goodwin said that three major drug firms, which he declined to identify, are anxious to win permission to produce the Peptide T substance that he said has potential for finding a vaccine to safeguard against the deadly disease that has threatened the lives of over a million people thus far.     Pert said that the clinical testing in the United States would involve at least a dozen AIDS patients in a controlled environment, probably starting next month, which would hopefully verify the chemical's usefulness.
