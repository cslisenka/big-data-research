MIDDLE SOUTH <MSU> GRANTED MISSISSIPPI STAY

Middle South Utilities Inc said the U.S. Supreme Court granted the company's Mississippi Power and Light Co's request for stay of a Mississippi Supreme Court ruling blocking a portion of the utility's retail rates.     In February, the state court had returned to state regulators a case involving the recovery of Grand Gulf one nuclear power plant costs at the rate of 28 mln dlrs per month. These rates, some of which were deferred for future phase-in, were granted by the state regulators in September 1985 based on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allocation of the power plant's cost among Middle South's subsidiaries.     Middle South said one condition of the stay is the posting of a bond that is suitable to the Mississippi Supreme Court.     Middle South said the Supreme Court stay brings stability to Mississippi Power and Light's situation and "removes the possibility of MP and L's imminent insolvancy while the case is proceeding on the merits."     The company said it expects its subsidiary's case to prevail on the merits, resolving for all Middle South System companies "issues concerning the prudence and retail rate recovery of costs associated with the Grand Gulf One nuclear unit."
