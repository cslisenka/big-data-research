There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries but the agency issued a seismic wave warning on the coast between Niigata Prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, and Noto Peninsula, to the west. The epicentre of the tremor was located in the Sea of Japan far off Niigata, it said.     The tremor was felt as far away as Yokohama, south of Tokyo, and Hamamatsu on the Pacific coast.
