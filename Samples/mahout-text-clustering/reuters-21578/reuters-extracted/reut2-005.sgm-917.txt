SWISSAIR JANUARY TRAFFIC UP, REVENUE DOWN

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> said its overall load factor for January was steady at 58 pct compared to the same period a year ago. Its seat load factor dipped to 58 pct in January from 59 pct in 1986.     A six pct rise in overall traffic in the month came on tonne-km capacity eight pct higher than a year ago.     Cargo traffic in the month was 10 pct higher than a year earlier and passenger traffic was up five pct, but unfavourable currency rates led to an eight pct fall in revenue.     Costs before depreciation were down nine pct in the month.  REUTER &#3;
