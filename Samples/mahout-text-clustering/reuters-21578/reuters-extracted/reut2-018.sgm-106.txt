LAWSON SAYS VOLCKER OUSTANDING FED CHAIRMAN

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Paul Volcker has been an outstanding Chairman of the Federal Reserve and he will be greatly missed, a spokesman for the U.K. Treasury said.     The spokesman was relaying Lawson's reaction to news that Volcker will not be seeking a third term as chairman. Lawson is campaigning in London ahead of the June 11 general election.     Lawson also said he thought Alan Greenspan an excellent choice as Volcker's successor and that he sees no reason to expect a change in policy.  Reuter &#3;
