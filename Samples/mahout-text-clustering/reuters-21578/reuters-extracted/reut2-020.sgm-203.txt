STOCKHOLM BOURSE EXTENDS TRADING BY 30 MINUTES

The Stockholm bourse authorities said they were to extend trading on the exchange by 30 minutes until 1500 (1400 GMT) because the afternoon call took longer than normal due to hectic selling pressure.     A spokeswoman told Reuters the measure was purely administrative and aimed at allowing the bourse time to process deals in exceptionally heavy turnover of around 590 mln crowns.     "It was necessary to extend trading hours as the call-over went on beyond two o'clock," she said.   REUTER &#3;
