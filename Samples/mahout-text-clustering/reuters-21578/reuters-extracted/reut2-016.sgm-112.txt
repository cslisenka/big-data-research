U.S. AUTO UNION WILL FIGHT TO STOP JOB/WAGE CUTS

The United Auto Workers union (UAW) vowed to fight wage and job cuts in a round of labour talks starting in July that cover nearly 500,000 workers at General Motors Corp <GM> and Ford Motor Co <F>.     "The UAW doesn't go around picking fights, but we don't run away from them when they're forced on us ... We want peace, but peace comes at a price," union president Owen Bieber said.     "And if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it," he said, in an address to 3,000 union leaders at the start of a four-day special convention.     He said the Detroit carmakers had turned their backs on America by the increasing use of imports that cost U.S. Jobs.     He said the union was ready to strike for "job and income guarantees," bans on shifting production to foreign and other non-union sources, and increases in pay and profit-sharing.     GM, under pressure from declining sales and profits, has said this year's talks will be difficult because it wants to limit wage rises and shed parts-manufacturing operations considered uncompetitive.     Contracts at both companies expire at midnight on September 14.  REUTER &#3;
