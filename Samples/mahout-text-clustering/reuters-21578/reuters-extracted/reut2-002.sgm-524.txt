ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO FREE REST OF CONTRA AID

The Reagan administration issued a formal statement to Congress designed to free the remaining 40 mln dlrs in 1987 aid for the U.S.-backed "Contra" rebels in Nicaragua.     The aid is the last instalment of 100 mln dlrs voted by Congress for the Contras, and is to be spent on major military equipment. Congress now has 15 days to disapprove of the 40 mln dlrs.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We think the prospects for approval are very good."     The long-awaited administration move followed by one day President Reagan's speech to the nation on a report on the secret Iran arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the contras.     In the House of Representatives earlier today, Rep. David Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters Democratic leaders in the House had decided to push for a 180-day moratorium on further aid. He said the House would vote next Wednesday.      Reuter &#3;
