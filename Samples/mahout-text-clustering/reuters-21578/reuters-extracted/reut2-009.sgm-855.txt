SWEDEN REVISES BUDGET FORECASTS

Sweden's state-run Institute of Economic Research released its forecast of economic indicators during 1987 upon which revisions to the state budget, due to be put forward at the end of next month, will be based.     The institute predicted an increase in exports by 2.2 pct to 277.72 billion crowns, with imports up 2.9 pct on 1986 to 247.51 billion.     The balance of payments current account, which showed a 1986 surplus of 7.6 billion crowns, will be reduced to a surplus of no more than 1.5 billion, according to the institute.     The state-run institute's forecast will be used as a basis for revisions which the Finance Ministry is due to make to the state budget, which was published in January.  REUTER &#3;
