U.S. DETAILS ITS ACTION PROGRAM FOR AFRICA

The U.S. Has given further details of an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping sub-Saharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems, senior U.S. Offficials said.     Under the new program, a 500-mln dlr Development Fund for Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral accounts currently in existence.     Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for Africa, said he believed Congress will favour the program, which stems from a U.N. Conference on Africa's economic problems.     The 500-mln dlr fund, coupled with an additional 100 mln dlrs in food aid, would surpass Congress' 1986 vote of 483 mln dlrs for equivalent programs, officials said.     Washington is also increasing its funding to the International Development Agency (IDA), the World Bank's soft loan affiliate, and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund for Africa, they said.     Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got 37 pct of 8.7 billion dlrs, but the Reagan administration wants this increased to 45-50 pct of 12.8 billion dlrs in new funds.
