REAGAN SENDS KUWAITI PLAN TO CONGRESS

President Reagan today sent a classified report to Congress on his plan to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with U.S. military escorts.     Congressional officials said the report, received by House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate majority leader Robert Byrd, will not be made public.     Congress has demanded a detailed security plan on how U.S. warships and servicemen would be protected from possible attack in the Gulf region, scene of the prolonged war between Iran and Iraq.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration intended to push ahead with the plan despite strong opposition in Congress.     He said the report to Congress provided a comprehensive overview of Administration strategy in the Gulf, adding the military escort plan would begin "when the President was satisfied that all preparations had been completed satisfactorily".     Fitzwater did not say when this might be, but denied the protection plan was being held up.  Reuter &#3;
