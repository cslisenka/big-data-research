U.S. WEST <USW> TO AGGRESSITVELY BUY BACK STOCK

U.S. West said it is aggressively buying back shares of its own stock under a resolution adopted in 1984 by its board authorizing the repurchase of up to 10 mln shars over any three-year period.     U.S. West has about 190 mln shares outstanding.     The company did not specify how many shares it was currently repurchasing.     "The fundamentals of our company remain strong," said U.S. West vice president and treasurer Jim Anderson. "We believe U.S. West stock represents good value and we are in the market aggressively buying shares of our own stock."  Reuter &#3;
