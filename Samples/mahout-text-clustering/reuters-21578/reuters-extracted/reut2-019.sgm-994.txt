EXPLOSION IN PHILIPPINE CONGRESS, NO INJURIES

An explosive device blew up in the Philippine Congress building early on Tuesday, a congressional security official said.     He said no-one was injured in the blast which damaged a telephone booth on the second floor at about 0825 local time (0025 GMT).     Captain Rosalo Ylagan, head of congressional security, said the device could have been a home-made bomb or a large firecracker. The explosion was being investigated, he added.     No congressmen were in the building at the time.  REUTER &#3;
