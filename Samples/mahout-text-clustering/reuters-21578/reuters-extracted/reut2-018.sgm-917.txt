OHIO EDISON <OEC> UPGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it upgraded Ohio Edison Co's 2.7 billion dlrs of debt securities.     Raised to Baa-2 from Baa-3 were the utility's first mortgage bonds, preferred stock and secured pollution control issues, and the guaranteed Euronotes of Ohio Edison Finance NV. Moody's upgraded Ohio Edison's unsecured issues and preference stock to Baa-3 from Ba-1.     The likely approval of a 152 mln dlr, or 10 pct, rate hike by Ohio Public Utilities Commission significantly reduces a key component of financial risk. It would be implemented on Perry Unit One's expected Fall in-service date, Moody's said.  Reuter &#3;
