CHINA AND PORTUGAL SIGN MACAO DEAL

Prime Ministers Zhao Ziyang of China and Anibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal signed an agreement to end more than four centuries of Portuguese rule over the territory of Macao and return it to Chinese control in 1999.     Macao will become a special administrative region on December 20, 1999, retaining a high degree of autonomy except in foreign affairs and defence. Its capitalist system is to remain intact for 50 years under an arrangement similar to the one that will return Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997.     China hopes to win back the Nationalist-ruled island of Taiwan under the same "one country, two systems" formula.     "The successful settlement of the question of Macao has proven and will continue to prove that the concept of 'one country, two systems' is realistic and therefore definitely viable," Zhao said.     Macao's population of 300,000 includes more than 40,000 Portuguese passport holders.     Peking has said Chinese nationals in this category will be able to use their Portuguese passports after 1999 but will not be entitled to Portuguese consular protection in Macao or elsewhere in China.
