FRENCH GOVERNMENT WINS CONFIDENCE VOTE

The French government won, as expected, a vote of parliamentary confidence sought by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac on his general policies.     Votes from Chirac's Gaullist RPR party and its junior partner in the ruling coalition, the centre-right UDF, gave Chirac's cabinet a slim majority in the National Assembly.     A total of 294 deputies in the 577-member assembly voted to support Chirac, with 282 voting against. One member was absent.     The Socialists, Communists and the extreme-right National Front voted against the prime minister's call.  REUTER &#3;
