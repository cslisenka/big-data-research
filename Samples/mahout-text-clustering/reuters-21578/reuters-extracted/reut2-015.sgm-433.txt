THREE KILLED IN BOTSWANA BLAST

Three people were killed and two others injured when a huge explosion, believed to be a bomb, went off in a suburb of Botswana's capital Gaborone.     Witnesses told Reuters the blast, near the headquarters of the Botswana Defence Force, occurred at about 2 A.M. (1200 GMT) and flattened several houses.     Minutes after the explosion Botswana soldiers sealed off the scene, which is near where South African troops last May launched a military attack against alleged guerrilla targets.  Reuter &#3;
