GM <GM> SAID TO CUT 2ND QTR OUTPUT SCHEDULES

General Motors Corp has cut 100,000 cars from its second quarter production schedule, according to Automotive News.     The trade paper, citing "sources both within GM and on the outside," said GM plans to build 1,042,708 cars in the quarter, a nine pct reduction from its earlier estimate. The cut could lead to further layoffs at GM, it said.     A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future  production schedules.     Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, which has high car inventories.     A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM part of the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities.     "They should be cutting a lot more than they are," Shearson Lehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even if GM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarter production, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.     Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the end of March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.     Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000 excess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.     The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs, although those would likely be temporary rather than indefinite layoffs, said Lucky.     He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunity to close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut two or three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more in line with demand.  Reuter &#3;
