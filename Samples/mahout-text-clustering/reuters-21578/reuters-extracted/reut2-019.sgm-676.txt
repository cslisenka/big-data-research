PENNZOIL (PZL) ADVISED OF SEC BRIEF

Pennzoil Co said it was advised by the Securities and Exchange Commission that that commission will file an amicus curiae brief in the Texas Supreme Court concerning the Pennzoil/Texaco Inc (TX) litigation, but said it was not aware whether that brief will adopt the position of one of the litigants.     Pennzoil said the brief is expected to be filed about July 20. "We do not know whether the brief will adopt the position of one of the litigants or simply be an inquiry and request for clarification of the reasoning of the two previous decisions in this matter, both of which have been favorable to Pennzoil, a Pennzol spokesman said.     Pennzoil said that regardless of the focus of the brief "Pennzoil will make an appropritate response in the court in due course."     Earlier today, Texaco said that in a letter dated June 26, the SEC's general counsel told attornys representing Texaco and Pennzoil that the commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federal securities law in the case between the two companies. The litigation stems from Texaco's purchase of Getty Oil Co in 1984 after Pennzoil had made an offer from Getty.  Reuter &#3;
