ITALIAN PRESIDENT FACES PROBLEMS CHOOSING LEADER

President Francesco Cossiga meets political leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.     Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister five times previously and whom the majority Christian Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again.     The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister.     Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general elections are likely unless agreement can be reached.     Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats.  After the consultations, Cossiga will name a prime minister-designate who will try to form a government.  REUTER &#3;
