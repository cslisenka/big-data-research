HOME SHOPPING <HSN> SETS STOCK OPTIONS

Home Shopping Network Inc said its board approved plans to offer a stock option plan for its cable television operators.     The company said it will offer the options in exchange for a commitment to operate the company's programs to a set number of subscribers for five years. The agreement also includes a five year extension option.     If the operator agrees to the plan, they will receive options to buy 10 dlrs worth of common stock for each cable subscriber committed, or 20 dlrs per subscriber, if they agree to run both programs, the company explained.     The company said the option will vest over a five year period at the rate of 20 pct per year.     The company, which offered a similar program last year, said the current one is directed for those who did not sign up last year, and for new carriers of the company's home shopping video shows.
