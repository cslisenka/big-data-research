LIBYA SAYS CHAD FIGHTING TO CONTINUE

Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said confrontation would continue in Chad unless French forces leave the country and rebel leaders share political power there.     "Any anti-Libyan regime in N'djamena can rest assured that it will never have a single comfortable night's sleep," he said in a speech carried by Libyan television and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.     Gaddafi repeated his stand that no Libyan forces are in Chad, saying he stood by Chad rebel forces of GUNT -- the Transitional Government of National Unity -- fighting the forces of President Hissene Habre, supported logistically by 2,400 French troops.     "As long as this movement (GUNT) continues to fight for the liberation of Chad we will continue to stand by its side with all force and firmness ... Whatever the battles, however long the conflict and whatever the alliance between the colonialists, the reactionaries and their agents," Gaddafi said.  REUTER &#3;
