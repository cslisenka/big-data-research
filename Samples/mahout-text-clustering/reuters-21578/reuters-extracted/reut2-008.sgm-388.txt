ROSTENKOWSKI URGES HONESTY IN FUTURES INDUSTRY

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Congress would more readily respond to the needs of the U.S. futures industry to be internationally competitive if the industry showed a willingness to do its business honestly.     Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association that if other countries were relaxing futures regulations "because ours are being tightened, so that they can take a competitive advantage, I think we (Congress) have a responsibility to keep you out in front."     But he told the futures leaders that they "have a more important reponsibility to do your business honestly. You can't ignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity."  Reuter &#3;
