BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 200 BILLION YEN IN BILLS

The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 200 billion yen in financing bills through 35-day repurchase agreements maturing July 24 to help mop up a projected money market surplus, money traders said.     The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 3.6005 against today's one-month commercial bill discount rate of 3.5625 pct and one-month certificate of deposit rate of 3.98/86 pct. Traders estimate a 300 billion yen surplus due to tax allocations to local governments and public entities. The operation will put outstanding bill supplies at about 2,000 billion yen.  REUTER &#3;
