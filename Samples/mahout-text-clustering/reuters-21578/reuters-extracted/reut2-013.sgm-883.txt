CHRYSLER <C> CANADA, MMC SITTIPOL IN SUPPLY PACT

Chrysler Canada Ltd, wholly owned by Chrysler Corp, said it concluded an agreement for MMC Sittipol Co Ltd to sell Mitsubishi Colt subcompact cars built in Thailand to Chrysler for sale in Canada.     Shipments of the Colts to Canada will start in late 1987, and Chrysler Canada plans to import about 8,000 units in 1988, rising to 20,000 units a year by 1990, the company said.     Chrysler Canada said it will import four-door sedan and three-door hatchback Colt models under Autopact trade agreement provisions, requiring Chrysler to provide Canadian production to offset each vehicle imported for sale in Canada.
