FDA OKAYS DRUG TO LESSEN HEMOPHILIACS' BLEEDING

The federal Food and Drug Administration said it approved for U.S. marketing a drug that reduces bleeding in hemophiliacs requiring dental work.     The FDA said the drug, tranemaxic acid, would lessen and in some cases eliminate altogether the need for blood transfusions in hemophiliacs who must have teeth extracted.     The drug will be made by Kabivitrum of Stockholm, Sweden and distributed here under the trade name Cyklokapron by Kabivitrum Inc of Alameda, Calif.     Hemophilia is a hereditary diseease whose victims lack the particular proteins that promote blood clotting.  Reuter &#3;
