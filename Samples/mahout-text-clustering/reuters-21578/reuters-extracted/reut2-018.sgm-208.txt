INTERNATIONAL <ICC.O> SETS NEW SOUND TECHNOLOGY

International Cablecasting Technologies Inc, said it introduced its proprietary new technology that can broadcast compact disk-quality digital sound into the home.     The company said the new technology, called digital modulation, permits noise-free, undistorted transmission of 10 channels of pure digital sound or data via satellite and cable into subscribers' homes, all on a single video channel.         According to the company, the first consumer service to be offered by International via the new technology will be SuperSound, a package of eight 24-hour commercial-free digital uninterrupted music channels to subscribers.     International said the SuperSound service is expected to be launched in late 1987 and generally available by early 1988.  Reuter &#3;
