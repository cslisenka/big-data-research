OMB CHIEF SAYS CONGRESS CLOSE ON DEFICIT CUTS

Office of Management and Budget Director James Miller said he believed Congress was moving closer to a compromise with the administration over federal budget deficit cuts for the coming fiscal year.     "I think Congress is moving in the direction of the president," he told Reuters as he was about to address a meeting of the Federal Managers Association.     He did not elaborate on this but said a reported agreement by House and Senate budget writers calling for about 36 billion dlrs in deficit cuts was "six billion too short." The administration proposed 42 billion dlrs in deficit reductions.  Reuter &#3;
