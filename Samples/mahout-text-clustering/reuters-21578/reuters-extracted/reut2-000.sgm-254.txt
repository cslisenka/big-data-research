SHULTZ LIKELY TO VISIT MOSCOW SOON

The officials told Reuters no decision had been reached on when the trip might take place, but it was likely to be within a month.     Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed on Saturday that talks on medium range missiles be separated from other arms issues.     Schultz is currently visiting Peking.  REUTER &#3;
