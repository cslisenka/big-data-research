GM <GM> PARTS WORKERS TO VOTE ON CONTRACT

Workers at a General Motors Corp parts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new contract that would change the way many of the workers do their job.     Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM's Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local contract to replace their current agreement with the company, according to officials of both the union and the company.     The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "team concept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of GM's Inland Division.     Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the plant would be responsible for the entire product and would make some of their own decisions about assembling that product, said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that represents the workers.     An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of the accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacity problem.     No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on a new national accord are expected to begin in July.     If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a member of the local's executive board.     The pact would also stay in place through the next national contract, he said.     Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the new accord. "It's going to be close either way," he said.     Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is not ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials said. The GM spokesman said "no decision has been made to that effect."  Reuter &#3;
