REAGAN CONVENES MEETING ON MARKET SITUATION

President Reagan was meeting this afternoon with his top economic advisers on developments in the stock market and the White House said he would issue a statement at 1700 EDT.     Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan met in the White House residence shortly after the market closed with Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Chairman Beryl Sprinkel of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and chief of staff Howard Baker.     Reagan scrubbed a reception for Republican presidential candidates to make room in his schedule for the meeting.  Reuter &#3;
