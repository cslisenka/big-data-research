ABM GOLD FILES FOR INITIAL SHARE OFFERING

ABM Gold Corp said it has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of six mln Class A common shares at an expected price of seven to nine U.S. dlrs each through underwriters led by PaineWebber Group Inc and Advest Group Inc.     The company said it will use about 30.6 mln dlrs of the proceeds to buy from Sonora Gold Corp 5,456,000 Sonora shares at 5.60 U.S. dlrs each, and Sonora will use about 25.0 mln dlrs of its proceeds from that deal to buy 9,259,000 shares of <Goldenbell Resources Inc> at 2.70 dlrs each.     ABM Gold said Sonora will use the 5,553,600 dlrs remaining to repay short-term debt and for working capital.     Goldenbell will use its proceeds from the sale of shares to Sonora to provide about half the financing needed to complete construction of production facilities for a property.     ABM said it will use another 8,120,000 dlrs of its proceeds to buy <New Jersey Zinc Exploration Co>'s 15 pct interest in net operating profits derived from some Sonora properties. ABM said it will trade this interest for 1,234,042 Sonora shares valued at 6.58 dlrs each. ABM will use another 2,825,370 dlrs of the proceeds to buy from <United Gold Corp> 1,053,000 United common shares at 2.29 dlrs each and exercise a warrant to buy another two mln common shares at 20.7 cts per share, with United to use its proceeds to fund exploration.
