NIGERIAN MILITARY MAY DELAY POWER TRANSFER

Nigeria's military rulers will transfer power to an elected civilian government in 1992, two years later than previously planned, at the conclusion of a gradual handover starting this year, official sources said.     The Armed Forces Ruling Council has approved the main details of the transition, which will probably be announced this week by the President, General Ibrahim Babangida.     Among other important decisions, the council has also chosen to limit the number of political parties under civilian rule to two, the sources added.  Reuter &#3;
