MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - MODEST MOVEMENT, BIDS FIRM

Country movement of corn and soybeans increased modestly this morning, and basis bids were steady to higher, cash grain dealers said.     Basis bids firmed in response to lower rates for barge freight, traders said, noting that the Ohio River is swelling with snow runoff, discouraging barge loadings because of the high water levels.     Moderate bookings continued in new crop soybeans, mostly for January 1988 delivery, with farmers pricing at least a portion of their crop at five dlrs a bushel or better when bids emerge at that level, they said.     Movement in Iowa was expected to slow considerably in the next few days, as farmers are beginning field work, they said.     Dealers bid 104 and offered 106 pct for PIK certificates.
