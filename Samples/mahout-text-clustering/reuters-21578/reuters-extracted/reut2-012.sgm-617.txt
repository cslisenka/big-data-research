LYNG DEFENDS U.S. MEAT INSPECTION SYSTEM

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, reacting to recent criticism of U.S. meat inspection, defended the program saying the United States has the best inspection system in the world.     Speaking to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he called recent "terribly biased" press reports critical of USDA poultry inspection. He cited a report on CBS "60 Minutes" which criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.     "I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspection system in the world," Lyng told the cattlemen.     Lyng said USDA makes every effort to minimize the levels of salmonella in poultry, but added "the total elimination of harmful bacteria is virtually impossible in this world."  Reuter &#3;
