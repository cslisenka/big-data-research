U.S. TAX INCREASE PROPOSED ON BEER AND WINE

Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, said he introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes on beer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.     His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27 dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents per six pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17 cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs per gallon respectively, he said in a statement.     "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirely justifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would also modestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said.  Reuter &#3;
