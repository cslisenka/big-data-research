EC UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS SLIGHTLY IN FEBRUARY

European Community unemployment fell slightly in February to just under 17 mln from 17.1 mln in January, the EC statistic's agency Eurostat said.     It said the fall came despite a bad winter in most of the EC when seasonal factors could be expected to have had a more adverse effect.     However, the agency added, the long-term trend was virtually unchanged stating that compared to February 1986 the number of registered unemployed increased by 222,000.  REUTER &#3;
