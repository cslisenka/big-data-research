CANADIAN IMPERIAL CONSIDERS BRAZIL LOAN STATUS

(Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) is considering classifying its 1.2 Canadian billion dlrs in loans to Brazil as non-accrual and will decide whether it will do so in June, bank chairman R. Donald Fullerton told reporters after a business speech here.     Fullerton said the loans would be listed as non-accrual in financial results for the second quarter ending April 30.     (Bank of Montreal), which has loaned about two billion Canadian dlrs to Brazil, the largest amount of any Canadian bank, previously said it is also considering declaring the loans as non-accrual in second quarter results.     Under Canadian guidlines, loans are classified as non-accrual when there are indications the bank will lose interest or principal on the loan or when it believes it will be difficult to fully settle the account within a reasonable period.     Several U.S. banks have already announced they plan to place their loans to Brazil on non-accrual lists.     Fullerton also said Canadian Imperial still plans to enter the brokerage business this year after the federal government introduces laws that will let banks expand their actitivities.     "We'll be looking at anything in the Canadian market at this point in time--from the very biggest (brokerage company) to the very smallest," Fullerton told reporters.     Fullerton said he considers buying seats on stock exchanges "a sensible move".     Fullerton declined to comment on TransCanada Pipelines Ltd (TRP)'s bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd (DMP). Canadian Imperial has about 900 mln Canadian dlrs in outstanding loans to Dome, making it one of the oil company's two largest Canadian creditors. The bank has a joint director on Dome's management board, Fullerton said.               Fullerton said he did not have enough information on the bid to evaluate its effect on Dome or its debt restructuring talks.     Fullerton called in a prepared speech for full reciprocity in any free-trade agreement with the U.S. involving financial services.     "There are strong indications that financial services are being bargained away in the current free trade negotiations between Canada and the United States with no requirement of full reciprocity," Fullerton said.               He said U.S. banks given equal privileges with Canadian banks here would be able to operate throughout the country while Canadian banks in the U.S. would be subject to approval and regulation by each state.
