SOUTHLAND <SLC> MAY BE DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may downgrade Southland Corp's 156 mln dlrs of debt securities and 125 mln dlrs (liquidation value) of preferred stock.     The agency cited Southland's announcement that it is studying various restructuring alternatives. S and P said that the company has been a rumored takeover target for a while, and a restructuring would probably be a defensive move to thwart an unfriendly bid.     Southland currently carries BBB senior debt and A-2 commercial paper.  Reuter &#3;
