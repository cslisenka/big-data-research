ONE OF TWO SARA LEE <SLE> STRIKES SETTLED

Sara Lee Corp said 500 workers at its Kitchens of Sara Lee bakery operation in Deerfield, Ill., have returned to work this week after ratifying a contract.     A company spokesman said members of Local Two of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers, who had walked out May 10, reached "mutually agreeable terms" in a new two-year contract.     Meanwhile, about 100 Teamster drivers and warehouse employees, whose contract expired May 16, remained out, the company said. No new talks were scheduled, Sara Lee said.     Details of the new contract were not immediately available, but a company spokesman said it "maintained benefits and called for no sacrifices from current employees."     Union sources reported that the contract freezes wages and introduces a sharply lower starting rate for new hires. They said it also gives Sara Lee concessions on a workplace issue involving excused absences.  Reuter &#3;
