HARLEY-DAVIDSON <HDI> SEEKS IMPORT RELIEF END

Harley-Davidson Inc said it is asking the International Trade Commission to terminate import relief for heavyweight motorcycles.     The company said it has regained the leadership in sales of the premium segment of the heavyweight motorcycle market and no longer needs special tariffs to compete with overseas competitors.  Harley is the only U.S. motorcycle maker.     The tariffs were imposed in 1983 when the ITC found that Japanese competitors had been flooding the market.  Reuter &#3;
