USDA ENDS SCREWWORM CONTROL POST IN ALBUQUERQUE

The U.S. Agriculture Department has ended its screwworm alert control program in Albuquerque, New Mexico, because the potential of a screwworm outbreak in the area has been contained.     The department said the program was set up after a case of screwworms was confirmed in a hunting dog being returned from Venezuela.     It said six weeks of surveillance has failed to turn up an additional cases of screrwworms.  Reuter &#3;
