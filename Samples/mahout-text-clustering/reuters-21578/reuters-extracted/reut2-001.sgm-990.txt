BETHLEHEM <BS> HAS INVESTIGATED CHAPTER 11

Bethlehem Steel Corp has investigated the ramifications of a filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws but has no present plans to file, a company spokesman told Reuters.     The spokesman said the investigation was made some time ago and was undertaken as a precaution in the interest of prudent management.     He said while Bethlehem, which has been losing money for several years, does not intend to seek protection from creditors now, it could do so if conditions worsened, particularly if it ran out of cash.     But the spokesman said Bethlehem ended 1986 with over 460 mln dlrs in cash on hand, partly due to the sale of assets over the year, and expects to maintain its cash position at around that level through 1987.     At the end of 1985, Bethlehem had less than 100 mln dlrs in cash.  Reuter &#3;
