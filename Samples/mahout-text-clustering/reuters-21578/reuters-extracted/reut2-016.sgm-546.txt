UNICLUB IN JOINT VENTURE

Uniclub Inc said it has agreed to form an equally-owned joint venture called Uniclub Marketing Inc with Goodway Marketing Inc.     The company said Uniclub Marketing will use narrowcast cable television, including Goodway's Video Shopping Mall television shopping program, to sell Uniclub memberships, add new participating merchants and sell Uniclob licenses and franchises.     The company said it expects the new program will give it enough cardholders, merchants and fee income to make Uniclub solidly profitable by year-end.  Uniclub markets a consumer charge card that gives members a 15 pct reduction on monthly billing for all retail purchases.  Reuter &#3;
