GERMAN BONDS END QUIET BOURSE LOWER

Prices of public authority bonds ended a quiet bourse session lower, with domestic investors taking profits in a technical reaction to recent strong gains.     Dealers said long maturities dropped as much as 50 pfennigs but most paper lost around 20 pfennigs. Foreigners, which had been buying and selling West German public authority bonds in pre-bourse business, remained sidelined during bourse trading.     Today's slight dollar drop and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit markets had little impact. Dealers said this week's G-7 meeting in Washington made investors wary and led to the squaring of some positions.     Most dealers said underlying sentiment for bonds remained favourable and there were some speculations global interest rates could fall further in the not too distant future.     The Bundesbank bought 109.9 mln marks worth of public authority paper here after selling 80.7 mln yesterday.     The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 40 pfennigs to 102.90, 103.15. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the same address also shed 40 pfennigs to 100.90, 101.15.     In contrast to the public authority bond sector, prices of mortgage and municipal paper firmed in active business, dealers said. 10-year yields fell two basis points to 6.26 pct.

Syndication managers said one new issue could be launched during the European afternoon.     But primary activity was expected to remain subdued in April. Only two or three further issues were expected during the first half of the month. The second half is shortened by the long Easter holiday weekend.  REUTER &#3;
