KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS

The chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan.     The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.     If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987.     The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore).     In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.     He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die."     He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated."     He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose."  Reuter &#3;
