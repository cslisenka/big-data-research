VALERO <VLO> PREFERRED STOCK UPGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it raised to B from B-minus Valero Energy Corp's preferred stock.     Also, the rating agency affirmed Valero's BB-minus industrial revenue bonds and B-rated debentures. About 950 mln dlrs of long-term debt is outstanding.     S and P said Valero's financial flexibility would improve as the company plans to use proceeds of roughly 760 mln dlrs from a proposed sale of natural gas operations to reduce debt. Pro forma debt leverage drops to about 30 pct from 67 pct at September 30, 1986. But S and P said Valero's refining segment has been unable to consistently generate operating profits.  Reuter &#3;
