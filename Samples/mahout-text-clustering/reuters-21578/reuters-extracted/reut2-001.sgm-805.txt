SENATE COMMITTEE POSTPONES BANK BILL VOTE

The Senate Banking Committee has postponed until March 10 its meeting scheduled for tomorrow to act on a bank regulation bill.     A committee aide said the postponement was requested by Republican members who wanted more time to look over a revised  draft version of the bill which was just introduced.     That version of the bill would allow non-bank banks to continue activities in operation as of March 5, but would prohibit them from starting other financial services.     The previous draft bill would have banned non-bank bank activities started after July 1, 1983.  Reuter &#3;
