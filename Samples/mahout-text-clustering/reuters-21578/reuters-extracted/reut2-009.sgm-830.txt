TURKEY COULD APPLY FOR EC MEMBERSHIP BY EARLY MAY

Turkey's European Affairs Minister Ali Bozer will arrive here on Saturday to set a date for his country's long-planned application to join the European Community (EC), expected by early May, diplomats said.     The Turkish embassy here said an application was expected "very soon" but gave no date. But sources close to the embassy said the application for full EC membership would probably be made in April, or at the latest, by the first week of May.     Bozer, is due to meet Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in London today to decide on the date of the application, they added.  REUTER &#3;
