JAL BOEING CRASH CAUSED BY FAULTY REPAIRS-REPORT

Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company <BA.N> was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd <JAPN.Y> 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people, the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says.     There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo.     The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster.     The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in late May. Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities.     Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4, a Boeing spokesman at the firm's headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation team's report until it was officially released.     On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash.
