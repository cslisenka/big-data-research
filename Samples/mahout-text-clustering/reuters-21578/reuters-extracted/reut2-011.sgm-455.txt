U.S. SPEAKER SEES EASY HIGHWAY VETO OVERRIDE

The House should override President Reagan's veto of the 88 billion dlr highway construction bill today by a comfortable margin, House Speaker Jim Wright said.     "We have counted and feel comfortable," Wright said. And he added, there may be 100 Republicans joining most Democrats in the Democratic-controlled House to override by the necessary two-thirds margin.  "If that's the case it'll be a very comfortable override," he told reporters.     The outlook in the Senate is less certain and Wright said that it will depend on whether senators "stay true to their convictions or cave in to White House pressure."  Reuter &#3;
