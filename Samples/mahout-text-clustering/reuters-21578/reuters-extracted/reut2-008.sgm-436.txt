WEST AFRICA NATIONS RECEIVE MOST EC EXPORT AID

Senegal, Ivory Coast and Ghana are the biggest recipients among developing nations of a special European Community (EC) aid program to compensate for lost export earnings, EC figures published today showed.     The EC has special trading and aid agreements with 66 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This includes a program called STABEX under which it provides aid to export-dependent countries if export earnings drop too much.     Senegal received about 155 mln European Currency Units (176 mln dlrs) between 1975 and 1984 mainly to compensate for a fall in its peanut export earnings.     The Ivory Coast received 108 mln ECUs (123 mln dlrs) and Ghana received 91 mln ECUs (104 mln dlrs) mostly to make up for a drop in coffee and cocoa export earnings.     Under the EC's STABEX aid program (export earnings stabilisation system), the Community provides special financial assistance to developing countries if export earnings in certain raw materials fall below an established level.     The EC provided about 1.06 billion ECUs (1.21 billion dlrs) in STABEX aid from 1975 to 1984, including 273 mln ECUs (311 mln dlrs) for losses in peanut exports, 261 mln ECUs (298 mln dlrs) for coffee and 150 mln ECUs (171 mln dlrs) for cocoa.
