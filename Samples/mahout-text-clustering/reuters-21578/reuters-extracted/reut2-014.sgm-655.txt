SENATE EXTENDS DAIRY COMMISSION REPORT

The Senate approved legislation to extend until March 31, 1988 the date for the National Commission on Dairy Policy to report on the federal milk price support program and the dairy industry.     The report is to recommend whether the Agriculture Department should have continued authority to reduce the milk price support level.     The one year extension was required due to delays in setting up the commission.  Reuter &#3;
