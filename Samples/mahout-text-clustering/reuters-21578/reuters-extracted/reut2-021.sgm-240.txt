PERIPHERAL <PSIX.O> COMPLETES BATTERY TESTS

Peripheral Systems Inc said it completed tests of the Nucell-50 radio isotope generating system, known as a resonant nuclear battery, designed to produce up to 50 kilowatts of AC electricity.     The Nucell-50, developed by privately-held <Nucell Inc>, converts the natural decay of radioactive materials directly into electricity whout a nuclear reaction or fission process, the company said.     Peripheral said it entered into a previously announced agreement to acquire Nucell, subject to shareholder approval, and has been providing research funds and engineering to it.     The merger calls for an unspecified amount of stock to be paid for Nucell, the company said.     The Nucell-50 unit, which measures 12 inches by 15 inches and weighs less than 50 pounds, can operate continuously for many years, the company said.     The device uses a small amount of radioactive material, which can be shielded for consumer use, the company said.     Initial funding of the Nucell research and development was provided by individuals, many of whom were officers and directors of Peripheral, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
