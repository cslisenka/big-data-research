MONOLITHIC <MMIC> TO DROP GATE ARRAY LINE

Monolithic Memories Inc said it plans to discontinue marketing its gate array integrated circuit product line and focus efforts on the market for field-programmable products.     It said the current market dynamics will hinder profitability in the gate array market for some time.     Monolithic also said it does not expect the move to have a negative impact on earnings, adding, the company has estimated that the gate array products would have contributed only one pct of revenues in fiscal 1987.
