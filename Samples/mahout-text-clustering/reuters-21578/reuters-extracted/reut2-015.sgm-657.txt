IRAN SAYS IT OPENS NEW OFFENSIVE NORTH OF BAGHDAD

Iran said it launched a fresh offensive today north of Baghdad, three days after it began a new thrust against Iraq on the southern Gulf war front.     The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the offensive began before dawn northeast of Qasr-e-Shirin, on the border 110 miles northeast of the Iraqi capital.     "Heavy casualties and losses have been inflicted on Iraqi forces in the fresh Iranian assault," IRNA said.     Iran today reported major gains on the southern front near the major Iraqi port city of Basra, saying its forces had captured an important defensive line.     Iraq said today it repelled an Iranian assault near its southern port of Basra last night, inflicting thousands of casualties on the attackers.     An Iraqi field commander told a correspondent of the official Iraqi news agency INA that four Iranian divisions were destroyed in the fighting. He said "Our forces are still engaged in repelling the enemy offensive, inflicting on them intensive losses, but (they are) in full control of the situation."     A Baghdad war communique last night said Iraq had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km from Basra while admitting Iran had occupied some fresh territory.  REUTER &#3;
