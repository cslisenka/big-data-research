CHINA TO CUT EXCESSIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FURTHER

China said it will continue its efforts to cut excessive capital investment, and noted policies to cool the economy have so far failed.     Fixed asset investment grew 16.7 pct to 296.7 billion yuan in 1986, outstripping energy and raw materials growth, the China Daily quoted Zhou Daojiong, president of the People's Construction Bank of China, as saying.     Over 160,000 projects costing 895 billion yuan are now under construction, and will absorb 60 pct of the funds earmarked for investment under China's current five-year economic plan (1986-1990), he said.     The state-run construction bank will review all investment projects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt those deemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.     Over 20 billion yuan of unauthorised spending by local governments or enterprises were partly responsible for the overheated rate of investment, he said.     Another two or three years of measures to curb excessive investment were needed to bring it under control, Zhou said.  REUTER &#3;
