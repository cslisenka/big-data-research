CALNY INC <CLNY> SUES PEPSICO INC <PEP>

Calny Inc said it has filed a multi-million-dlr suit against PepsiCo Inc and its La Petite Boulangerie unit.     Calny, which holds 15 La Petite Boulangerie franchises, alleges it and PepsiCo breached their agreements with Calny by failing to support the franchises in a number of ways.     The company further alleges that PepsiCo and La Petite Boulangerie had fiduciary responsibilities to Calny because of the longstanding relationship between Calny and Taco Bell, also a PepsiCo subsidiary. Calny operates 143 Taco Bell restaurants.     Calny said Pepsico misrepresented the readiness of the La Petite Boulangerie to expand outside San Francisco and misrepresented costs involved in operating the restaurants.  Reuter &#3;
