CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES OPEN SLIGHTLY FIRMER

CBT soybean futures opened steady, with new crop slightly firmer, then rallied further to hold gains of one cent to three cents per bushel higher in light early dealings.     A firmer Gulf soybean basis this morning, strength in corn futures and delays in the Brazilian soybean harvest supported soybean futures, despite a disappointing drop in the weekly soybean export figure yesterday afternoon, traders said.     A local professional house and a local house were the featured buyers of July, with sellers scattered and small-lot, pit brokers said.  Reuter &#3;
