DOLLAR OPENS EASIER IN QUIET FRANKFURT

The dollar opened easier in quiet trading and should stay firmly entrenched in its established range ahead of this week's round of international finance meetings, dealers said.     "There is little turnover, no new ideas or impulses," a dealer at a U.S. Bank said. "It promises to be a boring day."     He said the dollar's range was expected to be 1.8075 to 1.8250 marks in the run-up to the International Monetary Fund forum. The mark eased against some currencies on speculation call money rates could fall further. Despite this, the dollar opened lower at 1.8200/15 marks after yesterday's 1.8260/70.     The Bundesbank is due to announce a securities repurchase tender today. Money market dealers said funds may be allocated at lower than the 3.80 pct the bank has set since its monetary package at the end of January, softening the mark's undertone.     Sterling opened at 2.951/955 marks, just under yesterday's closing 2.954/958, and was seen firming further against major currencies on a wave of popularity for British prime minsiter Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservatives.     "Sterling is looking very healthy at the moment," one dealer said, adding that Japanese security houses bought pounds at the start of trading.     Dealers said the pound was also supported by an improved British economic outlook and stability in the oil market.     The Swiss franc continued to firm against the mark as investors took advantage of the interest rate differential.     It opened higher at 120.25/40 marks per 100 after yesterday's last 120.10/25.     The yen strengthened to open at 1.2520/2540 marks per 100 from yesterday's last 1.2490/2510 and the French franc was unchanged at yesterday's last 30.04/07 marks per 100.     The Belgian franc was stable at 4.828/830 marks per 100.     The Danish crown started at 26.48/51 marks per 100, little changed from yesterday's closing 26.49/51.     Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from late yesterday, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-9/16 pct. Six-month euromarks were stable at midpoint 3-7/8 pct.  REUTER &#3;
