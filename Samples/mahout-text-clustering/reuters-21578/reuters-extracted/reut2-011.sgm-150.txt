SMITHFIELD <SFDS> UNIT GETS UNFAIR LABOR CHARGE

Smithfield Foods Inc said that on March 27 the National Labor Relations Board issued a consolidated complaint against its Patrick Cudahy Inc unit.     The complaint charges that Cudahy engaged in unfair labor practices in connection with collective bargaining negotiations with the United Food and Commercial Workers international union and a strike by certain Cudahy's employees. The complaint is seeking relief as may be just and proper to remedy the unfair labor practices.     Cudahy denies the allegation and plans to contest the matter vigorously at a hearing on May 11.            Reuter &#3;
