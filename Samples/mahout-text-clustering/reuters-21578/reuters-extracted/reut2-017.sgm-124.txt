AMOCO <AN> TO SUPPLY LEADED GAS TO FARMERS

Amoco Oil Co said it will continue to sell leaded gasoline to farmers in certain portions of the midwest as long as there is sufficient demand for the product.     "It appears that the agricultural community will need limited amounts of leaded gasoline for certain types of equipment until an acceptable alternative is found," the company said.     Amoco previously announced it would sell all lead-free gasoline to motorists at its service stations.  Reuter &#3;
