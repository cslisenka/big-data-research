WEST GERMAN PRESIDENT HOLDS TALKS WITH ALFONSIN

West German President Richard von Weizsaecker met Argentine President Raul Alfonsin for talks on the first day of the German leader's four-day visit.     Local officials placed great importance on the meeting because Weizsaecker is considered a key backer here for more flexible repyament terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr foreign debt.     "I suppose (the debt) will be unavoidable" in talks, said Juan Carlos Pugliese, speaker of the lower house of the Argentine Parliament and one of Alfonsin's top political allies, before the meeting.     He said that "Germany in particular and most European countries" have supported more liberal repyament terms for Argentina's debt, Latin America's third largest.     An Argentine mission is now in the United States concluding negotiations on debt repyayment with 11 creditor banks.  Reuter &#3;
