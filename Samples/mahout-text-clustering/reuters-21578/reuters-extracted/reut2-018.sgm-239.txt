MOODY'S AFFIRMS COMPUTER ASSOC <CA>, UCCEL <UCE>

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it affirmed the Ba-3 rated convertible subordinated debentures of both Computer Associates International Inc, due 2012 and UCCEL Corp, due 1995. About 113 mln dlrs of debt is affected.     Computer Associates plans to acquire UCCEL through an exchange of stock, Moody's noted. The resulting merger would create the largest independent software company yet.     Moody's said it believes that the merged company may experience short-term pressure on margins while consolidating operations. In the long-term, the agency said the outlook is positive and anticipates a greatly improved market position.  Reuter &#3;
