PACIFIC RESOURCES <PRI> NAMED IN LAWSUIT

Pacific Resources Inc said it has been named in a lawsuit filed in California by Aetna Casualty and Surety Co <AET> relating to the 1984 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Paramount Petroleum Corp (PPC), in which a PRI subsidiary had a 40 pct stake.     Aetna is claiming up to 17 mln dlrs in compensatory damages and 30 mln dlrs in punitive damages against the defendants as a result of alleged acts to fraudulently induce Aetna to issue surety bonds for the benefit of PPC and its predecessor Pacific Oassis.     PRI said that the legal action against it lacks merit.  Reuter &#3;
