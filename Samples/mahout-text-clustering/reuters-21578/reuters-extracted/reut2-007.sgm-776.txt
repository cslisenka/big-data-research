PRESSURE BUILDS ON THATCHER TO CALL ELECTION

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came under fresh pressure for an early election today as financial indicators bolstered the government's forecasts of a boom in the economy following the budget earlier this week.     Two of the country's leading lending institutions announced cuts in home loans rates following Wednesday's cut in interest rates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent.     Analysts said today's reduction by Abbey National from 12.75 pct to 11.25, and one by the Halifax Building Society from 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would be followed by other main institutions.    One financial analyst commented: "I imagine the Abbey National is being toasted in Downing Street (the prime minister's residence) but not in the boardrooms of other big societies."     Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Nigel Lawson in his budget last Tuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatcher's rightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and the centrist Alliance, they said pressure was now building up on Thatcher to call a general election as early as June.     Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the form of a continuing drop in the number of unemployed, with government minister predicting that it would fall below the three million mark before long.
