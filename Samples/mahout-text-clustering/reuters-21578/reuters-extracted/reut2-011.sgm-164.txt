TAIWAN OFFSHORE BANKING ASSETS RISE IN FEBRUARY

The combined assets of Taiwan's offshore banking units (OBU) rose to 6.62 billion U.S. Dlrs at end-February from 6.28 billion in January and compared with 7.12 billion in February 1986, the central bank said.     A bank official said the increase came mainly from growing OBU borrowings by Taiwanese operators from their Asian counterparts.     He said the assets, held by 15 foreign and local banks, were mainly in U.S. Dollars, with the rest in certificates of deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia and the rest from North America and Europe, he added.  REUTER &#3;
