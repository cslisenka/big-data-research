WALL STREET STOCKS LOWER IN LATE TRADING

Wall Street stocks remained depressed in active trading. Weakness in the bond market reignited investors' anxiety about interest rates and triggered profit taking and arbitrage related program selling, traders said. Technology stocks were sharply lower.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23 points to 2383. Declines led advances by a two-one margin on volume of 171 mln shares.     General Motors gained 1-1/4 to 82-3/4 in active trading. Traders said investors expect postive comments at an analysts meeting at the end of the week.      Reuter &#3;
