CBS/FOX VIDEO SEES HIGHER 1987 REVENUES

CBS/Fox Video Co, an equal partnership of CBS Inc <CBS> and 20th Century-Fox Film Corp, expects revenues for 1987 to exceed 400 mln dlrs, up from 361 mln dlrs last year, President James Fifield said in an interview.     Despite a leveling out of video recorder sales, Fifield sees strong international business for the producer and marketer of prerecorded videocassettes. He also said expansion into non-theatrical products is bolstering results.     Fifield was in Chicago to attend the summer Consumer Electronics Show.     CBS/Fox Video projects the industry will sell about 116 mln units with a total manufacturers value of 3.3 billion dlrs.     Fifield told Reuters his company will introduce "at least 20 of our best titles" in the fall to accommodate the new Compact Disc-Video system.     He also said CBS/Fox will support the new S-VHS, or Super VHS high-resolution format with titles to match demand.  Reuter &#3;
