HARCOURT<HBJ> CHIEF SAYS MANAGERS ARE CONFIDENT

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc managers who use a special cash dividend to buy additional stock are demonstrating confidence in the company, chairman William Jovanovich said.     In a written statement Jovanovich said the company's recapitalization, which will pay a dividend of 40 dlrs per share in cash and preferred stock worth 10 dlrs per share, is not a leveraged buyout.     He said management of Harcourt is not receiving shares in the recapitalization other than through a legal employee stock ownership program.    Reuter &#3;
