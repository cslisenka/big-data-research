VIRAGEN <VRGN> TO BEGIN EXPANDED HERPES STUDIES

Viragen Inc said it will start an expanded study of its alpha interferon topical ointment for the treatment of genital herpes.     It said it will conduct a phase III study of two different dosage forms of the treatment and compare it to a placebo, or nonmedicated substitute, in at least 154 men and women. Viragen said study results are expected by October 1987.     Viragen said it is prepared to submit license applications for the ointment in England, Canada, and West Germany, in addition to the U.S., when the phase III study is completed.  Reuter &#3;
