JAPAN RELAXES RULES ON SECURITIES COMPANY OUTLETS

Japan has relaxed its limit on the establishment of securities company outlets in order to service a growing number of individual investors, the Finance Ministry said.     Japanese securities companies can now set up as many as 21 new outlets in the two years before March 31, 1989, against the previous maximum of 13.     The rules apply to outlets in department stores, supermarkets and other locations convenient for individuals.     Foreign securities firms are not affected by the ruling, it said.  REUTER &#3;
