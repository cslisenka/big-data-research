JUDGEMENT ENTERED AGAINST ARISTECH <ARS>

Aristech Chemical Corp said a judgment was entered against it in Texas State Court for nine mln dlrs plus prejudgment interest of 6,500,000 dlrs and legals fees of three mln dlrs.     It said the judgment arose from a suit filed by Union Pacific Corp <UNP> against USX Corp <X>, Aristech's former parent, in 1983, claiming damages for an alleged 1980 breach of a cumene purchasing contract by Aristech's predecessor, the USS Chemicals division of USX, which was then known as U.S. Steel Corp.     The company said it considers the judgment unjustified and it will seek to have it overturned.  Reuter &#3;
