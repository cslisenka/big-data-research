U.S. FIRMS LOBBY FOR DUTCH HELICOPTER ORDER

A delegation from McDonnell-Douglas Corp <MD.N> will visit the Dutch parliament on Monday in an attempt to win a 2.5-billion guilder helicopter order, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.     U.S. Helicopter manufacturer <Sikorsky> approached Dutch parliamentarians and army officials last month, he added.     The Dutch seek 50 new army helicopters over a 10-year period and plan to replace Lynx navy helicopters before the year 2000.     The first batch of 20 helicopters has to be operative in 1990, while the next 30 will be introduced gradually in the following years, spokesman Cent van Vliet said.     The U.S. Visit come as the Dutch have already narrowed down their options to the Mongoose of Italian producer <Agusta Spa> and the Panther of French firm <Aerospatiale>, Van Vliet said.     The Dutch had not considered U.S. Helicopters, he said, adding the Ministry planned to present its choice to parliament in May.     European models rejected include the Lynx III of British manufacturer <Westland>. A parliamentary accounting watchdog this week blasted the performance of 22 older versions of the Lynx currently used by the navy, saying they were hardly up to their job.  REUTER &#3;
