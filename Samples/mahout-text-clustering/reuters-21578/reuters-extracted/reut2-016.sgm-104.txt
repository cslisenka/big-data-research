TOKYO STOCKS PLUNGE IN MIDDAY TRADE

Tokyo's stockmarket index plunged sharply at the start of afternoon trade as investors took profits from last week's four straight record closes, brokers said.     The market index fell 427.48 points to 22,789.11 only 13 minutes after afternoon trading began at 13:30 local time.     Brokers said concern over weekend announcements of mounting trade tension with Europe and the U.S. Sparked the heavy selloff.     The average had risen 630.48 points in the last four trading sessions of last week.  REUTER &#3;
