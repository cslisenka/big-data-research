AFP IMAGING <AFPC> SEES HIGHER FISCAL 1987 SALES

AFP Imaging Corp said it expects revenues to reach about 20 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987, ending June 31, compared with sales of 16.8 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.     AFP said its products have continue to gain market share in the medical, dental and graphic arts industries over the past eight months, adding that it will spend "considerable effort" now to expand its KENRO pre-press vertical cameras and processors.     The company, which designs and makes film processing and camera equipment for the medical industry, said it plans to be a major player in the 10 bln dlr graphics art industry through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.     AFP also said it expects KENRO revenues to double during the coming fiscal year.     AFP said it is exploring the possibility of assembling and distributing a line of dental chairs and operatories for an unnamed company in the industry. AFP said the move could expand its DENT-X dental x-ray processing product presence in the dental equipment business whilke adding more factory loading.
