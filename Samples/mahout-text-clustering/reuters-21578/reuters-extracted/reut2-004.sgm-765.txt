APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS <ABIO> LOWERS SALES FORECAST

Applied Biosystems Inc said it has lowered its internal product sales forecast following a review of market conditions in Europe.     The company also said Chairman Sam Eletr has resigned for personal reasons.     The company said it now expects third quarter, ending March 31, sales to approximate the second quarter's 21.1 mln dlrs and third quarter earnings to be less than the second quarter's 2.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, due to unexpected European softness and previously announced new product delays.     Applied Biosystems earned 2,654,000 dlrs, or 20 cts a share, in 1986's third quarter on sales of 13.4 mln dlrs.     Explaining European orders have not materialized at the rate expectd, the company added "we believe that the slowness in orders reflects current conditions in the market for research instrumentation in Europe."     It said sales in the current quarter are also being affected by the previously announced delay in completion of the software for the Model 900A Data Analysis Module. The unavialability of that product also impacts sales of the associated model 420A Derivatizer system.     Applied Biosystems said it presently expects this software will be completed during the fourth quarter, but the resulting lack of demonstration units in the field may postpone some sales.     Due to the delays and European uncertainties, "we must now view the coming quarters with caution," it said, adding "some earnings pressure is anticipated during the remainder of this fiscal year."
