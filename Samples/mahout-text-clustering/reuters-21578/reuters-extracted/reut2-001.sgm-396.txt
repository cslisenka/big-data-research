AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE PLANS AD CAMPAIGN

The American Stock Exchange (Amex), which faces stiff competition from the New York Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market for listed companies, said it is launching a 2 mln dlr advertising campaign.     Amex will advertise on television for the first time, it said. The campaign also includes print ads.     "Our entry into television advertising reflects our optimism for the future. We have proved ourselves a vigorous and competitive marketplace and we are eager to communicate that wherever and whenever we can," said Arthurt Levitt Jr., chairman of the exchange, in a statement.     The exchange said its advertising campaign, with the theme "We Extend Your Reach,"  focuses on its role as a diversified financial exchange trading both stocks and options.     The television commercials will air on network, cable and local television stations. The commercials will be broadcast during March, May, September and November.     The commercials, titled "The Options Pit," and "An Attractive Investment," describe Amex's technology advances and international ties. The print campaign consists of four ads targeted to specific audiences: listed companies, individual investors, institutional investors and brokers.     The Amex currently has a two-way trading link with the Toronto Exchange and has an agreement with the Europeaon Options Exchange to trade XMI, the major market index of 20 blue-chip stocks, during European trading hours. The latter is expected to begin by mid-1987.      Reuter &#3;
