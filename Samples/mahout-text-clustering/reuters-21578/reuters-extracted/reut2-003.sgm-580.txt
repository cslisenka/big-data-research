EC COURT RULES IN FAVOUR OF CHEAP BUTTER PLAN

The European Court in Luxembourg has ruled a so-called "Christmas butter" scheme, under which surplus stocks were sold off cheaply, did not infringe European Community (EC) rules, a Commission spokesman said.     The spokesman said the Court rejected a case brought by three European margarine manufacturers which argued the EC Executive Commission did not have the power to launch the scheme in October 1984 without approval from EC ministers.     The plan was aimed at offloading 200,000 tonnes of butter from a one mln tonne stockpile at a specially reduced price of 1.6 European currency units per kilogram.  Reuter &#3;
