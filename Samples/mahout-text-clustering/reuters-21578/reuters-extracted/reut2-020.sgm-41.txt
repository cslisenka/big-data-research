LAWSON CALLS DEGREE OF SHARE FALL ABSURD

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock markets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by a spreading lack of confidence in the U.S. Economy.     Lawson said in a BBC radio interview, "This began on Wall Street. It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and) a lack of confidence in the U.S. -  and some careless talk by those who should have known better."     In a further wave of selling this morning in London, the FTSE 100 index had lost a further 233.2 points only 50 minutes after the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 1,819.1.     Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have been expected after the bull markets of recent years. "What was not expected was the severity of the downturn, which quite frankly is rather absurd."     He said he saw no fundamental signs why the U.S. Economy should go into recession, adding, "Indeed the possibility of higher (U.S.) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not lead the American economy into a recession."     "The only way in which the American economy would go into recession was if it actually talks itself into recession," he said.  REUTER &#3;
