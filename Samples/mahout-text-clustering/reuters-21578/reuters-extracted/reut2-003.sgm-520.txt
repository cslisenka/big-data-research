BANK OF CHINA TO JOIN VISA INTERNATIONAL

The Bank of China will become a card-issuing member of <Visa International> this year, Visa's chief general manager for Asia, Carl Pascarella, said in a statement.     Visa is designing a card for China, where international credit cards are accepted but not yet issued.     He said Visa was developing training programs for the bank on card issuance and processing procedures. A Chinese group will visit Visa's San Francisco headquarters next month to discuss future cooperation, he said.  REUTER &#3;
