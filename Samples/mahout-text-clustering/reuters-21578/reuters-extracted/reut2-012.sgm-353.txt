BANGOR HYDRO-ELECTRIC <BANG> GETS APPROVAL

Bangor Hydro-Electric Co said the Maine PUblic Utilities Commission approved changes in rates effective today that will decrease revenues by about 412,000 dlrs or 0.5 pct.     The decrease results from changes in the base rates and in the fuel cost adjustment rate charged by the company.     Base rates will decrease by 6.25 mln dlrs due largely to its sale in the Seabrook nuclear power project, a reduction in federal income taxes and lower costs of capital.     The base rate assumes a rate of return of 11.57 pct, down from 13.1 pct. Offsetting the decrease, however, is an authorization to increase fuel rates by 5.84 mln dlrs, it said.  Reuter &#3;
