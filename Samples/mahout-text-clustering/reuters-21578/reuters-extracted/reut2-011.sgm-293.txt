AVA/DIXONS LITIGATION DROPPED

Dixons Group Plc <DXNS.L> said that following an agreement with <Audio/Video Af~filiates Inc>, AVA, all litigation between the companies has been dismissed.     AVA filed suit against Dixons, Cyclops Corp, Allegheny Corp and others in connection with Dixons' recent tender offer for Cyclops on March 20.     Dixons also said in today's statement that Cyacq Corp agreed to end its competing tender offer of 92.50 dlrs per share for all outstanding Cyclops common stock, which total some 5.4 mln shares.     In line with Cyacq's decision, Dixons said it would now pay an additional 4.75 dlrs per share to each shareholder whose shares were purchased following its offer for Cyclops at 90.25 dlrs per share.     It said the additional amount, when added to the original tender offer, totalled 95 dlrs per share.     Dixons said on March 27 that it had raised its stake in Cyclops Corp to about 83 pct, and that it intended to increase from 90.25 dlrs to 95 dlrs the amount per share paid in the merger of a Dixons subsidiary with Cyclops.
