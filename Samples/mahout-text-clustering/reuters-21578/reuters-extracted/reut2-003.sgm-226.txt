WM WRIGLEY JR <WWY> SEES HIGHER 1987 SPENDING

Wm. Wrigley Jr Co expects the cost of technological improvements and renovation projects to push 1987's capital expenditures up considerably from last year's 25.4 mln dlrs, President William Wrigley told the annual meeting.     In 1985, the company's spending totaled 26.8 mln dlrs.     He also said the pace of the company's marketing activity set in 1986 will continue this year, with advertising and merchandising expenditures to exceed the 1986 level which Wrigley said was "somewhat over 100 mln dlrs."     Wrigley said product line extensions would continue in 1987, although the company has no immediate plans to venture into areas outside of chewing gum. He said Wrigley's overall share of the gum market is "a little less than 50 pct."     In answer to a question, Wrigley said there have been no buyout offers for the company.  He also said the company will continue to strengthen its international presence.  Reuter &#3;
