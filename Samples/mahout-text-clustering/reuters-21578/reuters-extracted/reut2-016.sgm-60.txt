TORONTO FINANCIAL DISTRICT HIT BY POWER OUTAGE

Toronto's financial district, the business heart of Canada, slowed to a near halt this afternoon after being struck by a power blackout, utility and business officials said.     The blackout occurred around 1515 EDT in about an eight-square-block section of the city's downtown core, home to most of the city's skyscrapers, containing the  headquarters of many of Canada's major corporations and financial institutions.     Ontario Hydro spokeswoman Christina Warren told Reuters the blackout occurred when a transformer cable went down during routine maintenance at a downtown hydroelectricity station. Power was restored after 10 minutes.     The power loss halted floor trading for 15 minutes on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's largest equity market, although computerized trading - accounting for about 20 per cent of the Exchange's normal volume - continued, Toronto Stock Exchange official John Kolosky said.     Bank operations were also affected. The headquarters or major offices of Canada's six major banks line a small section of Bay Street, the Wall Street of Canada.     Bank of Montreal spokesman Brian Smith told Reuters the blackout shut down electronic banking machines and caused a minor slowdown in money trading operations, although "all in all we were not seriously affected."     Officials at various downtown skyscrapers said the blackout also briefly shut down elevators and disrupted business in the downtown core's extensive network of underground shopping malls.     Workers at some of the buildings said several people were briefly trapped on elevators, but police and firefighters reported no serious problems.  Reuter &#3;
