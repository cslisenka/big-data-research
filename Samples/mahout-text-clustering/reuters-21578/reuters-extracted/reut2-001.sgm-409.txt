IRAQ REPORTS IRAN ATTACK REPULSED EAST OF BASRA

Iraq said its troops repelled an overnight Iranian attack east of the southern port city of Basra, scene of several Iranian Gulf war thrusts in the past two months.     A high command communique said "the attackers were met by heavy barrages of artillery, tank and mortar fire with the support of helicopter gunship raids."     Iran said it had made fresh gains in the attack southwest of the man-made Fish lake, some 10 km (six miles) from Basra.  Reuter &#3;
