HITACHI UNIT MAY WITHDRAW FROM U.S. MARKET

Hitachi Ltd of Japan's <HIT.T> Hitachi Electronic Devices (S) Pte Ltd, which suspended selling colour television tubes in the United States since January in anticipation of a "dumping duty," said that it may be pushed out of the U.S. Market if too high a final duty is assessed.     A company spokesman said that the Commerce Department had assessed a temporary 1.52 pct duty on tubes made by his company. The department said it would assess final dumping duties by September 8.     The company was Singapore's only exporter of colour television tubes to the U.S, he said.   &#3;
