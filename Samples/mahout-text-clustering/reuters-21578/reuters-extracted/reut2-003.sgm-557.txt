IMF WARNS ISRAEL PAY RISES MAY THREATEN STABILITY

The International Monetary Fund has warned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wages could undo the achievements of its economic stabilization program in controlling hyperinflation.     An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issued an interim report praising Israel's success in slashing inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without triggering mass unemployment.     But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of the perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on stabilization programs.     "Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress in reducing inflation and the present level of employment," the IMF said.     The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that higher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom were rekindling inflation. "Though wage developments and the reacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still time to put the stabilization program back on track," it said.     The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wage negotiations next month.     Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said real growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the government's economic stabilisation programme was introduced.     Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise to around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be necessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluation against the dollar in January.     Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing a policy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancing the budget.     The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fast last year and it supported the Bank of Israel's raising of interest rates in the last month.  REUTER &#3;
