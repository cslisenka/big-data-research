EQUITIES OPEN MIXED IN QUIET LONDON TRADING

Share prices opened mixed in relatively quiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At 0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5.     Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls, one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM, placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a period of consolidation is due.     An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party.     Operators said although the market is generally convinced the Conservatives will win the next general election, uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an unsettling influence.     Among the leaders, ICI lost 2p at 1,333, Beecham 8p at 525 and Glaxo 4p at 1,484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 on profittaking, dealers said.     Dealers also said fears of a trade war with Japan, although less acute, remain a nagging concern in the absence of fresh developments     Unilever gained 10p to 2,560, Dixons 4p to 373, British Telecom a penny to 253 and Reuters 2p to 701.     In lower oils BP shed 6p at 914 in the wake of news yesterday that Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell declined 5p to 1,228.     Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503, as did Natwest at 588.     Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds rose one penny to 488.     Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point, mostly due to bullish sentiment generated by today's opinion polls, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;
