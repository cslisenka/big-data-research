MCORP <M> AND UNITS' DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it lowered the ratings on about 489 mln dlrs of debt of MCorp and its subsidiaries.     Moody's said the change reflects the effect that the company's difficult operating environment will have on its asset quality, core earnings and equity base. It said the firm's asset quality problems are considerable and centered in its loans to energy and real estate sectors.     Ratings lowered include MCorp's senior debt to BA-3 from BAA-2, subordinated debt to B-1 from BAA-3 and preferred stock to B-2 from BA-1.  Reuter &#3;
