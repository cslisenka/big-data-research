SWIRE UNCOMMITTED ON PROPOSED NEW H.K. AIRPORT

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> and its 50.25 pct unit Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> are still undecided whether they would participate in the proposed new airport for Hong Kong, chairman of both Michael Miles said.     "We don't want to jump the fence prematurely. We want to know the government's position first," he told a press conference. "The new airport is still a long way away. But if it does go ahead we will be involved." He declined to elaborate but noted that no other company has more at stake in a Hong Kong airport than the Swire group, which controls <Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>.     The idea for a second airport has been proposed for more than a decade but in 1982 the government shelved the plan for being too expensive. Early this year a consortium led by <Hopewell Holdings Co Ltd> presented the government with a 25 billion H.K. Dlr scheme of infrastructure development including an airport, a deep water port and highways to China.     Hopewell said it will take a 20 pct stake in the project while Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HKG> and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HKG> will take a combined 20 pct. Earlier today Hopewell said <Jardine Matheson and Co Ltd> will take a five pct interest in the project.  REUTER &#3;
