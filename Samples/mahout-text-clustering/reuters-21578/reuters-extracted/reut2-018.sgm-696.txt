GM <GM> LAYING OFF 850 WORKERS AT TWO PLANTS

General Motors Corp said it will permanently lay off 850 hourly workers in August at its car assembly plants in Janesville, Wisc, and Lordstown, Ohio, due to production cutbacks in the slow-selling cars built at both facilities.     GM, the largest U.S. automaker but suffering from lower sales for months, said 350 of the 3,800 workers at the Janesville plant would be put on indefinite layoff effective August 11 as the production rate for 1988-model Cadillac Cimarrons and Chevrolet Cavalier compact cars is reduced by five units per hour.     Another 500 workers of the 5,100 employed at GM's Lordstown, Ohio, plant will be laid off effective August 24, the company said.     GM said it will begin that date its production of 1988-model Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbirds on two shifts with a cut of six units an hour from the current rate.    GM also said it will change its method for reporting indefinite layoffs to monthly releases from the previous weekly system "to achieve more complete, accurate and less-confusing reporting of production-schedule adjustments."
