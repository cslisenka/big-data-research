ASHLAND OIL <ASH> SEEKS CHEMICAL ACQUISITIONS

Ashland Oil Inc is actively seeking a chemical acquisition and is willing to spend between 100 to 200 mln dlrs, Chairman John Hall said.     "We're looking for privately held companies or units of other companies. We think it's too dificult to go (shopping) on the stock market where premiums are so high," Hall told Reuters. He was in Houston to address the annual meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.     "We're trying to grow in that area to cushion the oil price volatility," Hall said.     Hall said Ashland is seeking a chemical company acquisition which would complement its existing chemical businesses which manufacture adhesives, polyester resins and other products.     When asked if Ashland is considering divesting its money-losing oil exploration and production unit, he said "we do not have any spin-offs planned at this time."     Hall said the Ashland, Ky., based oil company would have strong margins on its chemical products throughout 1987, adding "right now we're struggling a bid" with the company's refining and marketing margins.     The Ashland chairman also said he hoped the U.S. government would consider some form of tax incentive to help develop costly synthetic fuels such as oil shales and coal liquification. "The lead time on that (kind of project) is so long, it's difficult for a private company or a company with shareholders to pay for reseach," he explained.  Reuter &#3;
