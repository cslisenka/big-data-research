ALSTHOM PLANS ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT JOB CUTS

Engineering group Alsthom <ALSF.PA> said it planned to slash 420 jobs this year from the 5,000 strong workforce in its electrical equipment division.     Details of the proposed staff reductions will be put to labour representatives at a meeting on March 19.     Company officials said the cuts were needed to adjust to a drop in orders from French state utility Electricite de France and the cancellation or postponement of unspecified export contracts.
