SONY <SNE> TO SHIP SAMPLE OPTICAL DISKS

Sony Corp said it plans to begin shipping samples in the fall of a 130 millimeter erasable magneto-optical disk system used for data storage. It said it estimates the cost of the sample drives will be one mln yen with sample media costing 30,000 yen.     Sony said it will ship samples to potential customers in Japan or overseas depending on demand.     Sony said the product's development stems from continued progress in key technologies such as newly structured recording layers using a polycarbonate base and high power lasers with high-speed data transfers, among other things.
