Bally Manufacturing Corp said it signed a definitive agreement to sell the stock of its Six Flags theme park subsidiary to an affiliate of Wesray Capital Corp.     Ccompletion of the proposed transaction is expected in early May, it said.     Bally said it will receive gross proceeds of 350 mln dlrs for the Six Flags subsidiary.     Bally said the transaction is part of its restructuring and will result in an after tax profit of about 100 mln dlrs.
