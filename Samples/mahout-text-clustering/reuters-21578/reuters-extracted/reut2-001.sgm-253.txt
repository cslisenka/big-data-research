KODAK <EK> CONTINUES DRIVE INTO NEW MARKETS

Eastman Kodak Co, best known for its cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost its image as a diversified information systems company.     The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast computerized libraries of documents and pictures.     Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.     Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J. Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business imaging systems division.     While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.     "We're launching a major attack on these new markets," Greco said.     "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.     But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a profit," he said.      Kodak also announced the first commerically available 14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers.  Reuter &#3;
