GYNEX <GYNXU.O> IN DEAL WITH WARNER <WLA>

Gynex Laboratories Inc said it signed an agreement under which Warner-Lambert Co's Chilcott Laboratories division will market Gynex's line of generic oral contraceptives.     Gynex Labs is a 50/50 joint venture owned by Gynex and Watson Laboratories Inc, a privately-held pharmaceutical company bnased on Corona, California.     Marketing by Warner Chilcott is currently scheduled to begin during the third quarter of 1987, it said.     Gynex signed a similar marketing agreement with Monsanto Co's <MTC> G.D. Searle and Co subsidiary in February 1986, which was terminated last April following a recall of the oral contraceptives due to packaging problems.  Reuter &#3;
