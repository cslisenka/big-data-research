REAGAN SAYS U.S. STILL PROBING ACID RAIN PROBLEM

President Reagan said the U.S. government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.     "We're still investigating this," he told a nationally televised news conference.     Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S. industry to help address the problem.     However, he declined to endorse the writing of federal standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem.     The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion dlr, five-year program to deal with acid rain, a problem that troubles U.S. relations with Canada.     Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government should set emission standards.     He responded that the deeper that officials went in examining the acid rain problem, the more complex it appeared.     He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a measure that might ultimately prove fruitless.  Reuter &#3;
