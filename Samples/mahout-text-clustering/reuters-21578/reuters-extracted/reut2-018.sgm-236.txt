HOSPITAL CORP <HCA> MAY BE DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may downgrade Hospital Corp of America's 1.8 billion dlrs of debt.     S and P cited uncertainties over the company's major restructuring. It noted that Hospital Corp has agreed to sell 104 acute care hospitals to a new company owned by an employee stock ownership plan.     The sale is for 1.8 billion dlrs cash. If the proceeds are used primarily for share repurchases, weaker asset and cash flow protection will result, S and P said.     Hospital Corp currently carries A-rated senior debt and A-minus subordinated debt.  Reuter &#3;
