AMES <ADD> FINDS INVENTORY SHORTAGE

Ames Department Stores Inc said its year-end audit has revealed an extraordinary inventory shortage at its Secaucus, N.J., distribution center and an investigation is in progress.     The company said it expects to report earnings for the year ended January 31 in about two weeks and estimates that net income will be 27 to 29 mln dlrs, or 72 to 77 cts per share, down from earnings of 40.4 mln dlrs or 1.19 dlrs per share earned the previous year.     Ames said the net income for the year just ended will reflect a decline in the gross margin percentage, an increase in the effective tax rate and the effect of the inventory shortage.     A company spokesman said most of the decline in earnings results from the inventory shortage.  Reuter &#3;
