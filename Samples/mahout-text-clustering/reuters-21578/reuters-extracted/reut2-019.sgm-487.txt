QATAR TAKES OVER CABLE AND WIRELESS FRANCHISE

Qatar will today take over the franchise of Cable and Wireless Plc (CAWL.L) in the emirate through the newly-created Qatar General Telecommunications Corporation (QTELC).     Cable and Wireless, which has operated in Qatar since 1951, will second expert staff and provide technical and computer services under agreements signed with QTELC.     Cable and Wireless manager Colin Davies told Reuters "Basically we have been here in a franchise situation for the last 36 years and the government has now decided they want to have a bigger role and that is, of course, a sovereign right."
