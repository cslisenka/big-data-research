SIX HURT IN SHOOTING AT SIKH TEMPLE IN AMRITSAR

Police and security forces entered the Golden Temple in Amritsar after six people including four policemen were wounded in a shooting incident in the complex, police said.     Police in Chandigarh, capital of Punjab state, said about 300 men entered the complex after a party of plainclothes police were fired on, apparently by extremists campaigning for a separate Sikh homeland.     It was the first time uniformed police had entered Sikhdom's holiest shrine since last June when extremists stabbed a temple guard to death.  REUTER &#3;
