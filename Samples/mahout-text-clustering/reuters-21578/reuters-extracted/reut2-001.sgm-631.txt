AVX <AVX> REACHES POLLUTION SETTLEMENT

AVX Corp said it has entered a two mln dlr settlement with the U.S. government and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to pay for damage claims against the company for contaminating the New Bedford, Mass., harbor with polychloride biphenyls (PCBs).     As part of the agreement, AVX said the government and Massachusetts have agreed to release it from further liabilities for polluting the harbor.     AVX said it has fully provided for the settlement's cost in its 1986 financial statements.     AVX, a multilayer ceramic capacitor producer, said the government had estimated damages to the harbor at about 50 mln dlrs.     But, it added, the government, the state and the Environmental Protection Agency are still awaiting the completion of studies to determine whether they will recommend a cleanup and what it will cost.     The studies will be completed next year, AVX added.     AVX said it is one of five defendents involved in the pollution litigation.     AVX said it is also engaged in litigation with its insurers to determine the applicability and the amount of coverage available to indemnify the company for payment of the the two mln dlr settlement or its share of the cleanup, if any.
