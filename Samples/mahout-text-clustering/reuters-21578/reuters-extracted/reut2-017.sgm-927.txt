OMAN CENTRAL BANK TO ISSUE TREASURY BILLS

Oman's central bank is expected to announce shortly the go-ahead for a weekly offering of treasury bills to the sultanate's 22 local and foreign banks, banking sources in Muscat said.     The central bank's board is due to approve the scheme at its next meeting on June 7 and it is likely to be explained to banks at a meeting with general managers scheduled for June 14, the sources said.     The decision to issue short-term government paper will come as a relief to banks in Oman which have been awash with liquidity but have few outlets for investment.     Oman's banks are allowed to swap only 40 pct of capital and reserves into foreign currencies, effectively preventing them from investing excess funds in eurodollar deposits where yields are much higher than in the domestic interbank market.     A treasury bill system would go some way to meeting banks' complaints on this score, bankers in Muscat said. Their dissatisfaction is expected to be voiced at the June 14 meeting if the treasury bill scheme is not launched.     Bahrain introduced a weekly treasury bill tender last December, offering local banks two mln dinars in 91-day bills by tender each Tuesday.     Other nations in the Gulf also offer banks short-term paper, with the United Arab Emirates issuing certificates of deposit each week while Saudi Arabia offers "bankers' security deposit accounts."     Both the Bahrain treasury bills and Saudi Arabian deposit accounts can be used by banks in repurchase agreements to obtain short-term money market aid.     Bankers in Muscat said the format of Oman's treasury bill offering is not yet clear. Some expect a maturity of 91-days, similar to Bahrain.  REUTER &#3;
