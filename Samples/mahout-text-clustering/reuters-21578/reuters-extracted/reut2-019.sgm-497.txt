NBC WRITERS, PRODUCERS AND TECHNICIANS ON STRIKE

Producers, news writers, editors and technicians began a strike at the National Broadcasting Co (NBC), leaving management employees to do their jobs.     The strike by members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees (NABET), representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000 workers, began at 12:01 A.M. (0401 GMT) after the network imposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable.     The union said its main objection to the contract was that it permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.     The average salary of workers represented by NABET is 65,000 dlrs a year.     Union officials said management was being intransigent and blamed General Electric <GE>, which purchased NBC and its parent company RCA in 1985 in a flurry of communications company takeovers.     The strike is the first for NBC since 1976.     The two sides said they have set no time to meet again.  REUTER &#3;
