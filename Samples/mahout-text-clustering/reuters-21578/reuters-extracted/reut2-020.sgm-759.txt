FLORIDA POWER <FPL> NUCLEAR FE PROPOSED

FPL Group Inc's Florida Power and Light Co subsidiary said the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has proposed a 225,000 dlr fine against the utility's Turkey Point nuclear power plant based on three previously identified incidents.     At the same time, Florida Power said, the NRC issued an order confirming the utility's commitment to implement a package of programs designed to correct problems at the facility.         In a letter accompanying the order, the Florida Power said, the NRC expressed concern about plant management controls, but indicated support of the utility's initiatives and said these efforts "should result in significant improvements in the performance of site personnel."     The three violations for which the fine was proposed occurred between December 1986 and July 1987.     Florida Power has 30 days to pay or appeal the proposed fine, it said.
