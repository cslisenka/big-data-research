IGENE BIOTECHNOLOGY <IGNE> FINDS CROP LOSS AID

IGENE Biotechnology Inc said its research teams at Auburn and Hebrew universities have found its patented pesticide is highly effective in combating a disease reponsible for approximately three billion dlrs in annual crop losses.     The company said it learned ClandoSan controls nematodes, deadly plant pathogens formerly controlled by now-banned synthetic chemicals.     Varieties of the deadly disease attack major cash crops such as cotton, vegetables, orchard trees, citrus fruits, and garden plants, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
