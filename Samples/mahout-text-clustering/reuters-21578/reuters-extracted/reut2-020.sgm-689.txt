INTERNATIONAL GAME <IGAM.O> EXPECTS PROFIT

International Game Technology said it will report a profit of between 900,000 dlrs and one mln dlrs, or 17 cents to 19 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.     Subject to a final audit, the company said it would post quarterly revenues of 21 mln dlrs to 23 mln dlrs.     For the year, International Game said it would report a profit of one mln dlrs to 1.1 mln dlrs, or 17 cts to 19 cents a share, on revenues of between 82 mln dlrs and 84 mln dlrs.
