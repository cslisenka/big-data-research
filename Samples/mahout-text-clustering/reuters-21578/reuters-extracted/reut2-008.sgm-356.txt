NASD TAKES DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST EX-TRADER

The <National Association of Securities Dealers Inc> said it has taken disciplinary action against Mark Woltz, a former trader of a major firm, suspending him from association with any NASD member for 20 business days, fining him 5,000 dlrs and censuring him.     NASD did not immediately identify Woltz' former employer.     The NASD said the disciplinary action was instituted by its Market Surveillance Committee for alleged violations of anti-fraud provisions under its Rules of Fair Practice.     The association said Woltz consented to the sanctions without admitting or denying allegations and the suspension will start April 27 and run through May 22.     It said its complaint alleges that from March 25, 1985 to April 4, 1985 Woltz engaged in a manipulative and deceptive practice known as marking the close of the market in a NASDAQ security. The NASD did not identify the security.     The NASD said the complaint alleges that Woltz, while his firm owned a long inventory position in the security, caused the firm's quotations of the security to rise on five days within five minutes of the market close, causing the firm's bid price to be the exclusive high bid at the market close on four days and the shared high bid on the other day.     It said the complaint alleges that before the market opened on each of the following business days, Woltz caused the firm's quotation to fall below its closing bid of the prior day.  At no time did the firm execute transactions at the artificially-raised prices, the NASD said.     The NASD said the complain also alleges that Woltz violated Article III, Sections 1, 5 and 18 of the Rules of Fair Practice.  Reuter &#3;
