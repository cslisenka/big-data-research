WORKERS VOTE TO LEAVE CATERPILLAR <CAT> PLANT

Strikers at the Caterpillar Inc tractor plant near Glasgow, due to be closed by the U.S.-owned firm, voted to end their occupation of the factory after more than three months.     A meeting attended by 700 of the plant's 1,200 workers approved an agreement reached with management on Thursday after four days of talks. Production will resume today.     The agreement calls for the establishment of a working group of representatives from both sides, which has been given until October 16 to find a new buyer for the factory.     The company has promised that there will be no job losses before that date. Workers began their occupation on January 14 after Caterpillar said it planned to close the plant and lay off the entire work force.  Reuter &#3;
