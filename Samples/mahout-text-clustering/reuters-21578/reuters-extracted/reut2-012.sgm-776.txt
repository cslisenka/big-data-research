BELGIAN BOURSE PREPARES FOR SECOND BIG FLOTATION

Investors on the Brussels bourse who flocked to participate in the flotation of shares in glassmaker <Glaverbel SA> may be rather more cautious when the offer of three million new shares in Belgian sugar refiner <La Raffinerie Tirlemontoise SA> takes place next month, analysts said.     This is mainly because Raffinerie Tirlemontoise is in the relatively static sugar market, they added. The Glaverbel issue of 755,000 shares at 1,850 francs each was more than 100 times oversubscribed and analysts said this showed that there will be no lack of liquidity for the sugar refiner's offer.      He declined to say at what price the new shares will be offered when they are floated between May 5 and 15, saying Belgium's Banking Commission has yet to approve arrangements.     However, analysts said local press speculation that the price would be between 1,500 and 1,800 francs appeared not too far from the mark.     Although the bourse saw some selling recently because of international factors, the key Belgian cash market index closed yesterday at 4,436.05 against 3,582.17 a year ago, a rise which has been fuelled in part by increasing international interest.
