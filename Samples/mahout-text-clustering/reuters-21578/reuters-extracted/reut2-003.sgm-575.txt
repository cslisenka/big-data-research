FLOOD THREAT EASES IN SOUTHERN NEW ZEALAND

Thousands of people evacuated from two towns in flood-hit southern New Zealand began returning to their homes late today as the waters began to recede.     A state of emergency had been declared in Southland province apart from the city of Invercargill and its port, Bluff, as rivers rose over four meters above normal after torrential rain.     Local officials in the farming province said stock losses were "miraculously low" but they expect major crop destruction.     Roads and rail links were cut and Invercargill airport was closed. Part of neighbouring Otago province also had a state of emergency with some rivers well above normal.  Reuter &#3;
