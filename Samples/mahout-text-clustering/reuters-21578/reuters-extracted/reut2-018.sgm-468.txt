AIDES URGE S. KOREA'S CHUN TO OPEN TALKS - RADIO

Aides to South Korea's President Chun Doo Hwan are urging him to reopen talks on electoral reform to defuse nationwide political turmoil, the state radio said.     It said ruling party officials would tell Chun he should consider reversing an April 13 decision to shelve the debate on reform until after the 1988 Seoul Olympics.     Ruling Democratic Justice Party executives met today to draw up a proposed package of measures. These included resuming talks, releasing political detainees and lifting the house arrest of top dissident Kim Dae-jung, the radio said.  REUTER &#3;
