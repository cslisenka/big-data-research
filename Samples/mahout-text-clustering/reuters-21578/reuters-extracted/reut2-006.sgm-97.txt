GALAXY OIL <GOX> CREDITORS TO FORECLOSE ASSETS

Galaxy Oil Co said it was notified by its secured bank lenders that they plan to foreclose on the company's material assets on April 7.     The company, which is in default of its 26.5 mln dlrs of bank debt and all of its other interest bearing debt, said it is unlikely that its board will accept the banks' latest offer for restructuring its debt.     Galaxy said that if an agreement cannot be reached with its lenders, it plans to file for Chapter 11 reorganization on or before April 7. It added that it is holding talks with other parties on debt restructuring alternatives.  Reuter &#3;
