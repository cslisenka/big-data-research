THAI INTERNATIONAL BUYS TWO DC 10-30S

The Cabinet approved a plan for state-owned <Thai Airways International Ltd> to buy two new DC 10-30 extended range planes for 126 mln dlrs, a government spokesman said.     He said Thai International will put the two aircraft on its Bangkok-Europe service as part of a 1988-1991 expansion plan.     The purchase of the new 'planes, due to be delivered late this year, is being partly financed by 62 mln dlrs from the airline's sale of its two old DC 10-30s to the Scandinavian Airline System.     The spokesman said the remaining 64 mln dlr cost of the new DCs is expected to be met by Thai International's own budget.     He said the national carrier was told by the Cabinet to consider seeking a foreign loan to finance the acquisition.     The government also asked Thai International to cooperate with the finance and communications ministries in reviving a Cabinet plan for the airline to raise its capital through a public flotation, the spokesman said.     He said a Cabinet decision in February 1986 called on Thai International to float up to 29 pct of the company, a proposal aimed at helping the airline meet its four-year expansion plan.
