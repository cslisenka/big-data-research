N.Y. FED PRESIDENT URGES BANK REFORM

New York Federal Reserve President E. Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants to maintain the separation of banking and commerce.     "As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our banking and financial system is compelling," Corrigan told the Senate Banking Committee.     Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks to offer a broad range of banking and financial services.     He said common ownership of banks, thrifts, securities firms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercial firms should not own or control insured depositories.     Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he would press for bank reform legislation this year and supported giving banks new power for commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds.     Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reform should reflect the reality that other companies were offering banking services such as checking accounts credit cards and mortgages.               "The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping at banks in some states, but not in others," Wriston said.     "There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 states at a Sears store or American Express office."     "We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to new customers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a business that is rapidly losing traditional products and customers," he said.     But John Weinberg of Goldman, Sachs and Co said allowing banks to enter the securities business would make banks too powerful.  Reuter &#3;
