The purchasers are Louis Wolfson III, vice president of <Venture W Inc>, an investment firm; Mark Blank, president of <National Brands Inc>; J. Patrick Michaels, Jr., president and chief executive officer of <Communications Equity Associates Inc>; and CEA Investors Partnerships II, a company Michaels would form for the purchase, Video said.     Video said it agreed to extend the period at the request of the prospective buyers in order to provide their respective counsels sufficient time to finalize the draft agreement which the parties have negotiated.         The company previously said that the outright purchase was valued at three mln dlrs, or an option purchase price of 250,000 dlrs excersizable until May 28, 1988.

Video said if the option expires unexercised, Video will grant an additional six month option to the buyers enabling them to purchase two mln shares for 1,750,000 dlrs plus the initial option purchase price of 250,000 dlrs.
