NORTH AMERICAN <NBIO.O> GETS FINANCING

North American Biologicals Inc said it has received a 10 mln dlr credit facility from Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co of Buffalo, N.Y.     It said the new credit would replace an existing 4.4 mln dlr line with Barclays PLC <BCS.L>, and due to more favorable interest rates, borrowing costs should be significantly reduced.     The company said half of the credit is designated for use in acquisitions.  It said it expects to conclude an acquisition, possibly outside its plasma and serum field, by year-end.  Reuter &#3;
