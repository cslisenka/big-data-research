First interest payments will occur Dec 10, 1987, it said.     FNMA said proceeds will be used to redeem the 300 mln dlrs of 7.65 pct debentures, 1.05 billion dlrs of 11.2 pct debentures that mature June 10, 1987, and to finance operations.     The debentures will be issued in book entry form only in minimum purchase amounts of 10,000 dlrs and multiples of 5,000 dlrs thereafter.     The debentures will be free to trade at 0930 hrs EDT tomorrow, FNMA said.  Reuter &#3;
