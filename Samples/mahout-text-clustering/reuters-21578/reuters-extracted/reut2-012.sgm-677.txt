ALCATEL TO RESTRUCTURE SPANISH SUBSIDIARIES

<Alcatel NV>, the telecommunications venture set up by ITT Corp <ITT> and France's <Cie Generale d'Electricite>, has accepted a proposal from the Industry Ministry to restructure ITT's former Spanish subsidiary, <Standard Electrica SA>, a Standard spokesman said.     He said Alcatel also has agreed to sell <Marconi Espanola SA>, owned 80 pct by Standard and 20 pct by Alcatel.     Negotiations to put Standard on a sounder financial footing have involved the government, Alcatel and Spain's telephone company, Compania Telefonica Nacional de Espana SA <TELF.MA>, which has a small stake in Standard and is its main customer.
