<SPENCER COS> SUES CHASE MANHATTAN <CMB>

Spencer Cos Inc said it sued two Chase Manhattan Corp units for forcing Spencer and its subsidiaries to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.     The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeks 100 mln dlrs in actual damages, 300 mln dlrs in additional damages and recovery of attorney's fees. In the nine-count complaint, Spencer contends that Chase Manhattan Bank, while purporting to negotiate additional financing, inflated Spencer's accounts, dishonored its checks and seized 600,000 dlrs from its accounts without notification.     The company said Chase then demanded immediate repayment of its 3.2 mln dlrs unsecured loan.     The suit also names Chase National Corporate Services Inc as a defendant.     The damages sought include a loss of about 40 mln dlrs on the liquidation of Spencer's Happy Legs Inc subsidiary, the footwear retailer said.     Spencer said it has recovered more than 500,000 dlrs of the funds seized by Chase and has obtained financing from a leading Boston bank.     Boston-based Spencer filed for Chapter 11 on Nov 19, 1986.  Reuter &#3;
