HYDRAULIC CO <THC> UNIT LAND SALE PLAN DENIED

The Hydraulic Co said its Bridgeport Hydraulic Co subsidiary had its proposal to use land sales proceeds to help fund capital improvements denied by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control.     Hydraulic said its proposal also called for a distribution of the finaical benefits to its stockholders and customers.     However, Hyraulic said the state utility commission would consider similar requests in the future. It said the utility commission felt its request was premature and noted  Hydraulic did not specify parcels of land considered for sale.     The company said it will submit a detailed plan shortly.
