UNION TAKES AMERICAN AIRLINES TO COURT

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants announced today that it was seeking a court order prohibiting any additional actions by AMR Corp's American Airlines restricting the right of its members to communicate with the public.     Patt A. Gibbs, president of the 10,000-member APFA, said the union took the action following the firing of 17 flight attendants who had been handing out information brochures at American's terminals at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.     The union has been negotiating for a new contract with the American Airlines for the past seven months. The union is seeking abolishment by the airline of a two-tier wage system for flight attendants.     Gibbs said at a press conference today that American had fired seven flight attendants "on the spot" last Sunday, and by Monday a total of 17 had been fired.  Reuter &#3;
