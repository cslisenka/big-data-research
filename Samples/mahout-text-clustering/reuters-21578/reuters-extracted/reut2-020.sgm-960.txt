EEP DAIRY CATTLE INITIATIVE TO EGYPT WITHDRAWN

The U.S. Agriculture Department has withdrawn the offers of dairy cattle to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program.     The department said the initiative for 10,000 head of dairy cattle was announced on September 12, 1986, and sales of 3,501 head have been approved since that date.     The department said it is its objective to complete sales within one year after announcing an initiative, and that initiatives are continued for over a year only if sufficient sales activity occurs.     It said it is giving exporters three days notice of the withdrawn in keeping with regulations under the program.  Reuter &#3;
