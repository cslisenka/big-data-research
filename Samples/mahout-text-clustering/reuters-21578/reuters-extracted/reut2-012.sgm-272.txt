HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES U.S. BUDGET PLAN

The Democratic-controlled House Budget Committee, over Republican protests, approved and sent to the House a trillion dlr spending budget for 1988 that would cut the anticipated federal deficit by about 38 billion dlrs.     The Democratic-written budget would produce about a 133 billion dlr deficit using the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office economic assumptions.     Using President Reagan's more optimistic assumptions the deficit would be about 108 billion dlrs -- which would reach a new budget law's goal.  Reuter &#3;
