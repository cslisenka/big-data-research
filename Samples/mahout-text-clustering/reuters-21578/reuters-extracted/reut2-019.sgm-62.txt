SWISS URGE CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN BANK REGULATION

The loopholes in Swiss banking supervision must be closed in a step-by-step manner, Swiss National Bank Vice-President Markus Lusser said.     The integration of financial markets had blurred the distinction between banks and bank-like finance companies, and the varying degree of regulation of the two sectors had a destablizing effect, he told the Association of Foreign Banks.     "It is in the interest of all market participants that these institutes (finance companies) be brought as soon as possible under banking supervision," he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the association's annual meeting.     It was important, however, that bringing finance companies under the banking law did not undermine Switzerland as a financial marketplace, Lusser said.     "It is decisive for its future that it succeeds in attracting and holding a wide variety of banks, financial intermediaries and financial experts," he said.     Lusser also urged greater harmonization of regulatory practice with other countries in view of the integration of world markets and the internationalization of the banking business.  REUTER &#3;
