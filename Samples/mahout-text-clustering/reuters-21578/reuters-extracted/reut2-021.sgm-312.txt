IGENE BIOTECHNOLOGY <IGNE.O> ENDS LICENSE PACT

Igene Biotechnology Inc said it terminated its license agreement with Hercules Inc <HPC> for the manufacture of Igene's natural food preservative and mold inhibitor.     It said the cancellation agreed to by both companies.     Igene said its Weyco-Serv product was licensed to Hercules in September 1985.     Under the terms of the agreement, Igene regains all rights, title and interest in its proprietary microorganisms, process and product and will repay out of future products sales certain royalties.         The cancellation of the contract allows Igene to proceed with plans to produce NaturServ, a modified version of Weyco-Serv, the company said. The new product is expected to be available early next year, Igene said.     The company also said it plans to build a new multiproduct fermentation plant to meet anticipated demand for NaturServ and other company natural products.     Both Weyco-Serv and NaturServ contain high concentrations of acid salts that naturally inhibit spoilage and molding, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
