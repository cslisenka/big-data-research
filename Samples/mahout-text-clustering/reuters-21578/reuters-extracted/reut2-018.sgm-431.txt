SOUTH KOREAN 1986 ENERGY USE RISES NINE PCT

South Korea's energy consumption rose nine pct to 61.07 mln tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 1986 from 56.0 mln in 1985, energy ministry officials told Reuters.     They said oil accounted for 46.7 pct of energy consumption in 1986 against 48.5 pct in 1985. Anthracite accounted for 21.0 pct against 21.5 pct, bituminous coal 16.5 pct against 17.3 pct and nuclear power 11.6 pct against 7.5 pct.     The amount spent on energy imports in 1986 was 4.53 billion dlrs against 6.54 billion dlrs in 1985, they said, with much of the difference between the two years due to changes in the price of oil.
