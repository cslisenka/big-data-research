WEST GERMAN FEED OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING

West German feedstuffs production is expected to decline further after it dropped to 16.5 mln tonnes in 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German Feed Stuff Industry Association (MFI) said.     Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around 75 pct in 1986.     He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to cheaper imports from abroad.     "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation," Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production to decline steadily."     The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by 0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes from 3.23 mln, he said.     Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairy cattle will decline even more this year because of the further cut in milk output from April.  Reuter &#3;
