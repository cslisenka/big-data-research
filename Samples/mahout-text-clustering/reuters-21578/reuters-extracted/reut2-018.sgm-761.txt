CRANE <CR> DEBT UPGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it upgraded Crane Co's 75 mln dlrs of debt.     Raised were the company's subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Ba-2 and in-substance defeased senior debentures to A-2 from A-3.     Moody's cited Crane's progress in reducing its exposure to such cyclical industries as steel and in strengthening its core businesses through acquisitions and cost reduction.     The agency expects Crane to have further improvement in operating margins. The diversity of Crane's businesses will strengthen cash flow and improve debt protection, it said.  Reuter &#3;
