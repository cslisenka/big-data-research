AIR MAURITIUS BUYS TWO BOEING 767-200'S

Air Mauritius has leased a second Boeing 747 SP jumbo jet and will take delivery of two Boeing 767-200 long-range airliners in 1988, the airline's general manager Tirvengadum told Reuters.     The second-hand Boeing 747, which was acquired on a renewable one-year lease, made its first scheduled flight to Munich earlier this month, he told Reuters.     Tirvengadum said the twin-engined Boeing 767-200's, costing a total of 130 mln dlrs, would be delivered in March and April next year.     Tirvengadum said the new aircraft would enable Air Mauritius to expand its services to Europe, Australia and the Far East and phase out its two Boeing 707's.     The airline will begin a weekly non-stop service to Geneva next June and hopes to obtain landing rights in Australia, he added.     Tirvengadum said South African Airways, which currently flies to Australia via Mauritius, will be forced to give up the route in November as a result of Australian sanctions.  REUTER &#3;
