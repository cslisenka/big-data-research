BACHE SECURITIES SETS NAME CHANGE, EXPANSION

Bache Securities Inc, 80 pct-owned by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co of America, said it would change its name on April 15 to Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd as the first part of a major expansion in Canada.     The investment dealer said the expansion would involve increased research and retail staff, three new Canadian branches by year-end and enhanced corporate financing ability.     Bache chief executive George McGough told a news conference that Bache might expand its 20 mln Canadian dlr capital base by up to seven times over the next several years.     McGough said the move resulted from the proposed June 30 deregulation of Ontario's securities industry, which will lift existing restrictions on the growth of foreign dealers such as Bache and allow it access to its U.S. parent's 134 billion U.S. dlrs of capital and products offered by Prudential Insurance Co of Canada, also owned by Bache's U.S. parent.     Stressing that company growth would be internal, McGough told reporters "that our game plan does not call for an acquisition," saying Bache recently rejected merger overtures from three other investment dealers in Canada.     McGough declined to identify the names of the three dealers that approached Bache.     He said that Bache hoped to rank in the top five Canadian investment dealers within the next few years. It now ranks about 14th.     McGough voiced confidence that Bache's plans would be unaffected by any delay past June 30 in the implementation of financial deregulation resulting from an ongoing dispute between the Canadian and Ontario governments over regulatory jusisdiction. He said regulators had already approved the name change and indicated they would approve Bache's expansion.  Reuter &#3;
