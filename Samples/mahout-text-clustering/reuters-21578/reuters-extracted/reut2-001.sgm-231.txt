FERTILITY/GENETICS <BABY> STUDIES ALTERNATIVES

Fertility and Genetics Research Inc said it will not establish further free-standing ovum transfer centers and is exploring the establishment of general fertility centers and alternative businesses.     The company said this followed its evaluation of unpublished technical information regarding some competing technology which, if substantiated and replicated, could adversely affect the company's operations.     Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transfer procedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertile couples to consider among the several alternative procedures available in advanced reproductive medicine.     "In particular, it is medically and psychologically superior to surrogate motherhood, because the fertilized egg is transferred prior to the gestation process, rather than after maternal bonding with the child has taken place," the company explained without further reference to the unpublished technical information.
