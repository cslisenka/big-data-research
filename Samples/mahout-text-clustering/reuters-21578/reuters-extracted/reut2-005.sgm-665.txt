MASSACHUSETTS GOV. DUKAKIS TO SEEK WHITE HOUSE

Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, a newcomer to national politics, ended weeks of speculation with the announcement he plans to seek the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.     Dukakis said he had authorized the formation of a presidential campaign committee and would make a formal announcement of candidacy in Boston on May 4.     The 53-year-old Dukakis is serving his third term as governor. He was reelected with 67 per cent of the vote last November.  Reuter &#3;
