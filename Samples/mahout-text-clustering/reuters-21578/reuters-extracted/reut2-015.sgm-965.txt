MOODY'S UPGRADES SOUTHWEST AIRLINES <LUV> UNIT

Moody's Investors Service said it has raised its ratings on about 50 mln dlrs of outstanding securities of Southwest Airlines Co unit, TransStar Airlines Corp, formerly named Musa Air Corp.     The agency has up the company's senior secured debt to Ba2 from B2.     The action reflects the improvement in the company's financial position since its acquisition by Southwest.     Southwest operates TransStar as a separate unit and has not legally assumed its debt.      Reuter &#3;
