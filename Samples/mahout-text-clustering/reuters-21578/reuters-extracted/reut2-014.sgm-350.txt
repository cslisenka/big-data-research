U.S. HOUSE LEADER THINKS TAX HIKE WILL PASS

House Democratic leader Thomas Foley said he thought the House would approve a budget resolution calling for 22 billion dlrs of new revenues including 18 billion dlrs of new taxes.     "I think we will have enough votes to pass the budget resolution and implement it," Foley told reporters.     Asked why he thought a majority of the House was willing to support higher taxes, Foley said, "The deficit problem has become more apparent." President Reagan has said he will veto any legislation raising taxes. The House is expected to act on the budget resolution this week.  Reuter &#3;
