MERCK <MRK>, SQUIBB <SQB> BENEFIT FROM STUDY

Merck Co <MRK> and Squibb Corp <SQB> will benefit from a study that shows lower levels of blood cholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries, lowering the risk of heart attacks, industry analysts said.     Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body's production of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 months ahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year.     "Certainly this study will create greater acceptance of anti-cholesterol drugs," said Robert Uhl, a drug analyst at F. Eberstadt Fleming.     Although neither company's drug was used in the study, which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University of Southern California School of Medicine, both are leaders in a new class of drugs that fight cholesterol.     The study, reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed lower levels of cholesterol, achieved through a combination of drugs and special diet, slowed and in some cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in the heart's arteries.     Such build up leads to heart attacks, the leading cause of death in the U.S.     Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterol could immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptoms of coronary artery disease. The study advocated reduction of cholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.     As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry analysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug therapy will gain wider acceptance.     In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein said "the culture can shift in terms of drug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally alter their diets".     The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600 mln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market, analysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs annually in about next five years.     The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low cholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and colestipol, a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977.     But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say the new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. "Niacin leads to tremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach upset," Crossen said.     Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to 30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. "It isn't fun to take," Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks restricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under 10 mln dlrs a year.     In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have little side effects because they target a key factor in the body's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the liver.         "Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather variable," said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice president at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a clear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.     Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a tablet form swallowed once or twice a day.     Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late summer or fall.     Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988, Sanders said.     Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also have cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug, but only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of cholesterol inhibitors.
