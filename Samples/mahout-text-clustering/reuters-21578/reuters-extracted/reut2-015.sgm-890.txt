EUROPEAN OFFSHORE RIG COUNT CONTINUES TO CLIMB

Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in the European/Mediterranean area continued to show strong gains last week, increasing nearly two percentage points to 46.1 pct, Offshore Data Services said.     The total number of working rigs in Europe and the Mediterranean region was 71, reflecting an increase of three during the week, compared to a total of 111 working rigs at this time last year. In the previous week, the area also gained three working rigs.     Offshore Data Services said the worldwide utilization rate for the week remained steady at 53.9 pct, reflecting a total of 392 working rigs. Last year, a total of 479 rigs were working throughout the world.     In the Gulf of Mexico, the utilization rate decreased slightly to 35.5 pct, from 35.6 pct the previous week because of the addition of one rig to the Gulf fleet. A total of 83 rigs were working last week in the Gulf out of a fleet of 234.  Reuter &#3;
