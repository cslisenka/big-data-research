FHLBB APPROVES FUNDS TRANSFER TO DALLAS BANK

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it voted to transfer one billion dlrs cash from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) to the Dallas Federal Home Loan bank tomorrow to correct a collateral deficiency.     The infusion was needed because the value of collateral behind FSLIC loans to savings and loan associations in the region had declined, an FHLBB official said.     The official said that as a result, auditors of the Dallas bank, one of the 12 regional federal home loan banks, would be able to give an unqualified opinion on the bank's condition.  Reuter &#3;
