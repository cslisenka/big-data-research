RENAULT TO HAVE SOME DEBT CANCELLED BY FRANCE

The French government plans to cancel part of Renault's debt as part of a strategy of returning the state car group to financial independence, but will not provide it with more subsidies, industry ministry sources said.     The plan, which has been under study for several weeks, is linked to legislation enabling Regie Nationale des Usines Renault <RENA.PA> to be converted into a limited company, they said. This legislation should be ready for parliament in the next few days, the sources said.     Renault's debt would be cut to some 40 billion francs from the December, 1986 level of 56 billion francs, they said.  Reuter &#3;
