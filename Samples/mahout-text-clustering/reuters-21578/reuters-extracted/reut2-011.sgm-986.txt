GERMAN BOURSE TURNOVER FOR FIRST QUARTER DETAILED

Share and bond turnover on all eight West German bourses in the first 1987 quarter was valued at 483.4 billion marks, according to the new method of calculating turnover, the Association of German bourses said in a statement.     The statement, however, did not give figures on the total number of share and bond units transacted.     While shares posted a turnover worth 187.9 billion marks, bond turnover was 295.4 billion marks. No comparative figures were available because of the new method of calculation.     In March, share and bond turnover rose 28 pct to 181.1 billion marks from the previous month, reversing the sharp turnover drop in February. Average daily turnover rose to 8.2 billion marks against 7.0 billion in February.     Bond turnover jumped 33 pct to 113.3 billion marks in March, giving an average transaction value of 455,000 marks each on the total 249,000 transactions. More than 90 pct of the turnover was in public authority bonds.     Share turnover rose 22 pct to 67.8 billion marks. With 1.5 mln deals, share transactions averaged 45,000 marks each.     German shares accounted for Nearly 80 pct of share turnover. Foreign shares took up over eight pct and domestic and foreign options, about 12 pct. Deutsche Bank <DBKG.F> was the most traded share in March, with 4.7 billion marks worth changing hands.
