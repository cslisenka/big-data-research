BABY M CUSTODY AWARDED TO STEARNS

A family court judge ruled that Mary Beth Whitehead cannot have custody of Baby M, the daughter she bore a childless couple in a surrogate agreement that stirred international controversy.     Judge Harvey Surkow ruled that the one-year old baby belongs solely to William and Elizabeth Stern, who paid Whitehead 10,000 dollars to bear Mr Stern's child.  Reuter &#3;
