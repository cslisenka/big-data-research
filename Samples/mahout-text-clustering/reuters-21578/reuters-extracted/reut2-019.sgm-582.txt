THOUSANDS TRAPPED IN BANGLADESH FLASH FLOODS

Flash floods and high winds have trapped some 10,000 people and injured at least 50 in northeastern Bangladesh's Sunamganj district, officials said.     They said water, knee-deep in at least 10 villages following heavy rains last Wednesday, was receding after extensively damaging crops and property.     The situation was aggravated by a 40-mile-per-hour storm which swept across the area yesterday and flattened at least 200 houses, the officials said but gave no other details.     Relief Ministry officials, describing the floods as a "routine hazard," told Reuters relief squads had been dispatched to the area with food and medicine.  Reuter &#3;
