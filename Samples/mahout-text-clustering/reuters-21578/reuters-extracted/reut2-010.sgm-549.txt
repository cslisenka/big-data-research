MOODY'S DOWNGRADES GELCO <GEL> AND UNIT'S DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said that it downgraded Gelco Corp's variable rate notes and convertible debentures to Ba-3 from Ba-2.     It also lowered the ratings of Gelco unit CTI International Inc's senior debt to Ba-3 from Ba-2 and CTI's subordinated debt to B-2 from B-1. About 486 mln dlrs if affected.     Moody's said the changes reflect the reduced levels of debt protection resulting from Gelco's restructuring efforts. Moody's said it is not adjusting Gelco's B-2 subordinated debt rating because it remains an appropriate assessment of risk.  Reuter &#3;
