SIERRA LEONE COUP ATTEMPT FAILED

Forces loyal to President Joseph Momoh foiled an attempted coup apparently led by senior police officers in Sierra Leone, government sources said.     The revolt included an unsuccessful raid on a Freetown military arsenal during which a police officer's driver was shot dead, they said. Police sources said a senior policeman was arrested on suspicion of leading the coup attempt.     There were no immediate reports in the official news media.     Police and troops patrolled the centre of the capital and there was no sign of further trouble.  REUTER &#3;
