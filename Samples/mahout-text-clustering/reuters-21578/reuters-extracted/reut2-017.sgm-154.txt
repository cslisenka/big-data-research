SPAIN APPROVES AID FUNDS FOR STEEL INDUSTRY

The Spanish cabinet agreed a 223.33 billion peseta aid package for the steel industry to restore the sector to profitability by 1989, Industry Minister Luis Carlos Croissier said.     He told reporters at a news conference the money would be shared among four state and privately-owned mills, which now operate at a loss.     The funds will be used to help modernise the industry, increase productivity and cut production to 17.5 mln tonnes a year from a current capacity of 18.2 mln tonnes.  Reuter &#3;
