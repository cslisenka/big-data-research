BELL CANADA PLANS LONG DISTANCE TOLL CUT

Bell Canada, a unit of Bell Canada Enterprises Inc <BCE>, said it applied for an average eight pct cut in Canadian long distance rates.     The application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission would also reduce the initial period for operated-assisted calls from three minutes to one minute and operator- and customer-dialed calls would be charged the same.     The billing of operator-assisted calls would include a conection charge, however. The new rate structure is similar to schedules announced by Bell January 1 for calls within Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Northwest Territories, it said.               Reuter &#3;
