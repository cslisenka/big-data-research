DUFF/PHELPS LOWERS ATLANTIC CITY ELECTRIC <ATE>

Duff and Phelps said it lowered the ratings on Atlantic City Electric Co first mortgage bonds, collateralized pollution control revenue bonds and debentures to DP-5 (high A) from DP-4 (low AA) and preferred stock to DP-6 (middle A) from DP-5, affecting about 500 mln dlrs in debt.     The rating change is a result of a New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' decision that lowered overall net rates by 15.9 mln dlrs, D and P said. The board disallowed about 22.4 mln dlrs of the utility's 239.8 mln dlrs investment in the Hope Creek nuclear plant which will have to be written off by 1988.  Reuter &#3;
