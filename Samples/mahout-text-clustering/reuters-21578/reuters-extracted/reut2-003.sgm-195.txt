OEA <OEA> GETS SPACE SHUTTLE SYSTEM CONTRACT

OEA Inc said it received from a division of Rockwell International Inc <ROK>, a contract to design and develop a space shuttle egress slide system which could be used under post-mission landing conditions.     OEA said its Inflation Systems International Inc subsidiary will produce ten of the post-landing emergency egress slides. The system is expected to allow the crew to exit the space shuttle through a side hatch on the left side of the crew's compartment, it said.     "There is no showing that (the owners') reasonable investment-backed expectations have been materially affected by the additional duty to retain the small percentage that must be used to support the structures protected by (the law)," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court's majority.     He was joined by Justices William Brennan, Byron White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun.     However, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, joined by Justices Lewis Powell, Sandra O'Connor and Antonin Scalia, argued that the law deprived the owners of constitutionally guaranteed protections.
