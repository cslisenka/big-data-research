SEMICONDUCTOR FEBRUARY BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO 1.13

The Semiconductor Industry Association said the February three-month average book-to-bill ratio was 1.13 pct, compared to a revised 1.12 pct in January.     The January figure was revised from the 1.11 pct reported last month.     In its monthly survey of U.S., European and Japanese semiconductor makers, the association said average orders for February totaled 788.2 mln dlrs, compared with 780.2 mln in January and 684.3 mln in February a year ago.     A book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 means that for every 100 dlrs worth of product shipped, manufacturers received 113 dlrs worth of new orders.     The association said February shipments were 677.8 mln dlrs, up 4.9 pct from the 645.9 mln shipped during January and seven pct higher than the 633.5 mln reported in February a year ago.     Three month average billings for February totaled 699.4 mln dlrs, up 0.2 pct from January's 697.8 mln, the association also said.     "The continuing improvement in the U.S. semiconductor market reflects the fact that U.S. electronics equipment manufacturers' sales are finally increasing," Semiconductor Industry Association president Andrew Procassini said.     The figures of the past few months suggest that the industry is experiencing a gradual recovery that is likely to continue, said Edward White, semiconductor analyst at E.F. Hutton Group Inc.     But he also said semiconductor makers still need a pickup in capital spending within the high-technology sector before any dramatic upturn can take place.     The February figures show strong single-month improvement in the semiconductor industry, but after closer examination they may prove to be disappointing to investors, said Michael Gumport, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.     "On the face of it these numbers are below recent expectations," Gumport also said.     A 1.15 or higher book-to-bill ratio had been expected, Gumport said.     He also said the three month average book-to-bill ratio, which was reported earlier than expected, reflected a downward revision in the December order total, Gumport said.     December's order rate amounted to 757.5 mln dlrs, down from the earlier-reported 783.8 mln dlrs, the association said.  Reuter &#3;
