MIYAZAWA, BAKER TALKED RECENTLY OVER TELEPHONE

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he recently talked with U.S. Treasury James Baker over the telephone, but declined to say what was discussed.     Miyazawa told reporters he talks with the U.S. Treasury Secretary from time to time on economic issues.     The Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper reported Baker called Miyazawa early this week to warn him next week's Group of Seven talks would not be a success unless Japan expands domestic demand. The newspaper quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) sources.     Miyazawa told reporters the LDP will come up with a draft economic package to stimulate the economy before he leaves next week for Washington.     The Finance Minister leaves on April 7 to attend the IMF and World bank meetings.     Miyazawa did not say what would be in the LDP package.  REUTER &#3;
