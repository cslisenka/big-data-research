It said the New York firm consented to the entry of the commission's order without admitting or denying the finding.

Midland was declared insolvent in 1983.     The SEC ordered that any new review of Main Hurdman procedures to include the adequacy of consultations between the firm's main office and its local offices and the implementation of the firm's policies.     It said the Midland office conducted the Bank audit, although some senior partners in New York were consulted, and its Houston office conducted the Time Energy audits.     The SEC said also that Main Hurdman agreed that if it is acquired by a larger firm, its practices will be integrated into the combined firm, including training programs and quality control reviews.
