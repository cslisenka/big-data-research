HEAVY SNOWS HIT GREECE, ITALY

Blizzards lashed Greece today, piling up to 10 feet of snow in places and paralyzing transport in what state radio called unprecedented weather conditions for this time of year.     Except for a handful of flights of the national airline Olympic Airways that took off before the blizzards started, all air traffic in and out of the Athens international airport was canceled, radio said.     The weather service said heavy snowfalls would continue for several hours.     Cold weather also hit southern and eastern Italy. Heavy snowfalls caused long delays and difficulties for road, rail and air traffic.  Reuter &#3;
