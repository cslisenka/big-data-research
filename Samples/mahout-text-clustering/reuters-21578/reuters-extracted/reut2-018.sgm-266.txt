DATA GENERAL <DGN> SEES LITTLE SALES UPTURN

Data General Corp said sales continue to remain flat and it sees little evidence that demand will pick up in the near future.     The company had not "really seen any major change" in demand, vice president of group marketing, J. David Lyons, told Reuters in an interview. "Our sales have been moderate to flat, but certainly not down," Lyons said.     Data General president Edson de Castro declined to comment on his outlook for the computer industry or on the company's performance.         Wall Street analysts said they were not surprised by the less than confident message from Data General which earlier today announced computer networking products to link personal computers with networks of its minicomputers and computers from other vendors.     "They've tried a number of different things that haven't seemed to work," said Paine Webber analyst Stephen Smith. "Data General is finding that aggressive pricing alone isn't enough" to win sales," Smith said.     In the second quarter ended March 31, Data General posted an operating loss of 24.4 mln dlrs, or 91 cts a share, compared to earnings of 2.0 mln dlrs, or eight cts a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter fell to 315.2 mln dlrs from 318.8 mln dlrs.     Despite reports of an upturn in sales at rivals Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> and International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Data General said it was not convinced that the minicomputer market had emerged from a two-year slump.     "We would rather wait until we see a sustained improvement in orders," Lyons said.         Lyons said new hardware and software introduced by the company are a response to customers who want to tie together their growing number of PCs and to connect them with larger mini and mainframe computers.     He said the products are part of a new strategy of providing industry-standard systems that allow computers from different vendors to share and exchange information.         Analysts noted that Data General is one of many companies promoting the integration of PCs with other office computers.     "PC integration is a tough strategy," said Smith.     "A lot of people are coming to the market from a lot of different angles," he said.  Reuter &#3;
