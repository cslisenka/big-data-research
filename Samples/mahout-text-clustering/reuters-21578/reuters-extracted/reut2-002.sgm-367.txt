PENNEY <JCP> TO SELL TELEMARKETING SERVICES

J.C. Penney Co said it will sell telemarketing services to other companies through a newly established wholly-owned subsidiary, Telemarketing Network Inc.     The New York-based subsidiary will use a network of 14 telemarketing centers Penney has already established. The centers are part of its catalog marketing operation.     A large domestic motel chain already uses the network for its reservations services, Penney said.     Frank Engels, director of telemarketing, was named chairman of the new subsidiary.  Reuter &#3;
