WORLD AIRWAYS <WOA> LAYS OFF 103 MORE EMPLOYEES

World Airways said it laid off an additional 103 employees in its contract maintenance operation at Oakland.     Over the past five weeks, the company previously laid off 274 maintenance employees.     The layoffs resulted from declines in current and projected maintenance work, which the company provides principally for other air carriers.     World Airways said it cannot rule out additional layoffs, as it explores a range of alternative for its contract maintenance operation.  Reuter &#3;
