N.Y. COCOA FUTURES QUIETLY LOWER EARLY

Cocoa futures were slightly lower early in quiet trading that was devoid of fundamental or technical features, traders said.     Locals tracked the London cocoa market while many speculators chose to stay sidelined, waiting for the buffer stock manager to enter as a buyer, traders said.     Origins and manufacturers were inactive, traders added.     Cocoa for May delivery was off nine dlrs at 1,925 dlrs a tonne in a 1,928 to 1,922 dlr range.     July was off 10 dlrs at 1,957 dlrs.
