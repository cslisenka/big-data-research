EASTERN AIR <TXN> SEEKS MORE ARGENTINA FLIGHTS

Texas Air Corp's Eastern Airlines Inc said it asked the U.S. Department of Transportation to approve an increase in the number of its weekly roundtrip flights to Buenos Aires to 11 from five.     It said if several of Pan Am Corp's <PN> one-stop flights to Buenos Aires were terminated in Rio de Janeiro, Eastern could add four non-stop flights from the U.S.     The expanded weekly schedule would include seven nonstop flights from Miami, two from New York, and two one-stop flights from Los Angeles via Lima.
