WEST GERMAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS RISE IN FEBRUARY

West German new car registrations in February increased by 31 pct over January's figure but trailed the February 1986 total by 2.9 pct, the Federal Motor Office said.     February new car registrations totalled 190,175 compared with the year ago figure of 195,852 and last month's 145,122.     New car registrations in January had fallen 41.6 pct against December, reflecting the end of tax incentives aimed at encouraging West Germans to buy cars with catalytic converters.     The office said total February new vehicle registrations, including those for trucks and buses, fell to 205,376 from 210,084 in February 1986 but were well above January's 157,357.  REUTER &#3;
