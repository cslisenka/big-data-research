"We are clearly telling users that Apollo is committed to maintaining its price/performance leadership in the workstation marketplace," said Thomas A. Vanderslice, Apollo's chief executive officer.     Apollo also said it will offer new color and monochrome models for the Domain Series 3000, its entry-level workstation family.
