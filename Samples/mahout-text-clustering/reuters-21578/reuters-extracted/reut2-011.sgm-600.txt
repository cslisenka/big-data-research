BRITAIN GIVES FAMINE RELIEF AID TO MOZAMBIQUE

Britain has granted Mozambique about eight mln sterling for food aid and emergency relief for famine victims, the British High Commission announced.     A high commission (embassy) statement said about 30,000 tonnes of cereals worth six mln sterling would be shipped to Mozambique, and the first load of 20,000 tonnes was due soon.     Britain will give one mln sterling for other disaster relief programs and 1.3 mln sterling to relieve the plight of Mozambican refugees, it added.     The statement said Britain would also contribute 1.3 mln sterling to the U.N. Refugee agency, UNHCR, for refugees in neighbouring countries, and give 750,000 sterling to relief agencies for food transport and distribution in Mozambique. The British public has also raised more than one mln sterling.  Reuter &#3;
