INDIA EXPORTS ITS FIRST PASSENGER CARS

India today signed an agreement to sell 500 mini passenger cars to Hungary, its first export contract for cars, an industry ministry spokesman told Reuters.     Under the agreement signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) - an Indo-Japanese car maker - and Hungary's state-owned Mogurt trading company - the cars, valued about two mln dlrs, will be delivered in 1987, he said.     "We expect Hungary will buy up to 5,000 Maruti cars per year from next year if the first batch proves popular in that country," he said without elaborating.     The launching of 800 cc Maruti cars in 1983 revolutionised the country's dormant automobile industry, which until then had marketed models which were at least 30 years old.     The Indian government owns 74 pct stake in MUL, and the balance of 26 pct is held by Suzuki Motor Co Ltd of Japan.     The Japanese-style Maruti, costing about 81,000 rupees, is the cheapest car on the Indian market and has proved a popular model, with order books full for the next three years, industry sources said.     MUL and India's three private companies have a combined production capacity of 206,000 passenger cars a year.  REUTER &#3;
