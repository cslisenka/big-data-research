CAPTAIN CHARGED IN AQUINO BOMBING

Military authorities say an unnamed army captain has been arrested for involvement in last week's bombing of the Philippine Military Academy.     They told reporters the arrest of the captain had been ordered after a search of his home revealed bombs and ammunition.     Four people died and 40 were injured in the blast, which President Aquino said was designed as an attempt on her life.  Reuter &#3;
