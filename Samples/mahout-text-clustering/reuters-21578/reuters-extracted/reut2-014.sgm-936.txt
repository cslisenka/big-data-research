U.K. GOVT TO INJECT 283 MLN STG INTO ROLLS ROYCE

The U.K. Government will inject 283 mln stg gross into <Rolls Royce Plc> when the company is floated at the end of this month, the pathfinder prospectus for the sale said.     The government will offer all 635 mln existing shares, as well as an unspecified number of shares created through the capital injection, for sale to the public, the prospectus said.     The sale price will be announced on April 28 and the offer will close on May 7. Trading is expected to begin on May 19.     The offer will be made in the U.K. Only and there will be no offering of shares overseas, it said.     No allocation will be made of more than 10 pct of the shares in the company, and the government will hold on to a "golden share" to secure that the aero-engine manufacturer remains under U.K. Control, the prospectus said.     Chairman Sir Francis Tombs said in the prospectus special arrangements were being made for U.K. Employees and pensioners of the company to buy shares on a preferential basis.     Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Paul Channon said the capital injection of 283 mln stg would ensure the company had a sound a balance sheet when it returned to the private sector after 1971.
