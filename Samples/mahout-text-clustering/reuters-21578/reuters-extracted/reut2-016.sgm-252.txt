TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS

Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, on Saturday told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     He said the ministry sent a proposal to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.  Reuter &#3;
