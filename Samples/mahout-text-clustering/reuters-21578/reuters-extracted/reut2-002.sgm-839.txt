U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES JAPAN OPEN MARKETS

The director of the Treasury Department's office of international banking and portfolio investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to more U.S. firms.     "The Treasury would like to see greater openness of Jaspanese markets, including more U.S. firms admitted to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and an increased role for U.S. financial firms in the Japanese Government bond market," Ammerman said in a prepared speech for a conference on financial services sponsored by Georgetown University.     Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes "any discrimination against U.S. banks wishing to set up in the securities business in Japan in their own name will be eliminated promptly."     He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop giving favored treatment to domestic banks over U.S. competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives.     He said the United States will "press vigorously for liberalization" of financial services in all foreign markets. If negotiations fail, "We will not hesitate to take vigorous actions to promote or protect our interests," he added.  Reuter &#3;
