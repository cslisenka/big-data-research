BANK OF NEW YORK <BK> DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed ratings on 500 mln dlrs of Bank of New York Co debt after the bank set a special LDC loan loss reserve.     Affirmed are the A-plus senior debt rating, the A subordinated debt, A-1-plus commercial paper and respective A-plus and A1-plus ratings on certificates of deposit of Bank of New York and Bank of New York (Delaware).     S and P said the bank's 135 mln dlr addition to its loan loss reserve conservatively addresses LDC exposure. S and P said the resulting second quarter loss expected will not substantially diminish fundamental earnings strength.  Reuter &#3;
