PIONEER COMMUNICATIONS <SOAP.O> DROPS NEW TITLES

Pioneer Communications Network Inc said it has temporarily suspended printing new titles for its Soaps and Serials line of paperback books and will now print only those titles that have demonstrated a profitable sales history.     It said it will no longer sell the entire Soaps and Serials line as a unit but will take orders for individual titles.     The company said it currently has enough licensor-approved manuscripts to provide, after publication, for at least six months of retail operations.  Reuter &#3;
