GENCORP <GY> EXTENDS SHAREHOLDER RIGHT PLAN

GenCorp Inc said its board extended to April 13 the date the rights issued under the company's shareholder rights plan will trade separately from the common stock.     The company said the plan, originally adopted February 18, has been extended several times since its adoption.     GenCorp said the rights plan makes it more difficult for an outside company or person to takeover the company. The plan has been extended indefinitely and to no person acquiring 20 pct or more of the common stock prior to April 13, the company said.     The plan calls for the attachment of one preferred stock purchase right to each common share outstanding.    On Monday, GenCorp announced it will buy up to 54 pct of its own outstanding common shares for 130 dlrs per share. It said details of the plan will be announced by the end of the week.
