SAS CUTS PEAK-SEASON U.S. DISCOUNT AIR FARES

<Scandinavian Airline System> said it has cut the price of its peak-season Super Apex fares from New York to Scandinavia about 150 dlrs.     The airline said there will be comparable savings from other U.S. gateways. The new fares, which are subject to government approval, were introduced so SAS can remain competitive with all scheduled carriers from the United States to Scandinavia, it said.     SAS said the price of a round-trip Super Apex ticket from New York to Copenhagen, Oslo, Bergen and Gothenburg during the shoulder season -- the month of May and from mid-August to mid-September -- will be 644 dlrs midweek and 694 dlrs on weekends with Stockholm 50 dlrs higher.
