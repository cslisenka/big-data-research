NOVA <NOVX> TO GET BRADYKININ ANTAGONIST PATENT

Nova Pharmaceutical Corp said the U.S. Patent Office has allowed its patent for bradykinin antagonist drugs. Nova said patents have also been filed in other countries worldwide.     It said it has the exclusive worldwide rights to these patents for the first bradykinin blocking drugs being developed as topical pain relievers and in nasal spry form for treating common cold symptoms.     Nova said Bradykinin is the most powerful paing-producing substance in the body and is considered, based on scientific evidence, to be the initial stimulus of pain.  Reuter &#3;
