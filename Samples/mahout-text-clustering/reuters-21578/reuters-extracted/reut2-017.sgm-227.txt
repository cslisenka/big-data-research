VENEZUELA FINANCE MINISTER TO SEEK JAPANESE CREDIT

Finance minister Manuel Azpurua said he will visit Japan in mid-May to seek new credits for planned expansion in Venezuela's state-owned aluminum, steel and petrochemical industries.     Azpurua told reporters he will be accompanied by central bank president Hernan Anzola and director of public finance Jorge Marcano.     "The idea is to hold meetings with Japanese economic and financial authorities, with the banks which have business and credits in Venezuela and with some of the Japanese companies already active here," Azpurua said.     Azpurua said he was optimistic about the trip, in light of Japan's recent announcement it will disburse 30 billion dlrs in new credit to Latin American countries.     "I think this trip is being taken at an opportune time and will allow us to reveal the potencial which this country holds for the Japanese economic community," Azpurua said.     He would not say how much Venezuela will seek in credits from Japan.  REUTER &#3;
