NMS <NMSI> TO DEVELOP HOME AIDS TEST KIT

NMS Pharmaceuticals Inc said it has begun developing a home test kit for detecting an antibody to the AIDS virus.     The company said its Animial Biotech Corp subdiary, which will develop the test, recently completed development of a simlar technology for a home test kit for feline leukemia virus in cats that exhibits similar properties to the AIDS virus, HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus.         NMS is the first firm to annouce the development of a home test kit for AIDS. The company said it should have a working model ready in the first quarter of 1988.     Abbott Laboratories <ABT>, based in Chicago, is the worldwide leader in the 60 mln dlrs AIDS test market with about a 50 pct share. Abbott also recently applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market a new test that will be ablet to detect early infection with the AIDS virus and help monitor the progress of therapy.         NMS said its home AIDS test would use proprietary technologies and advanced genetic engineering techniques for the home test kitS. NMS said the test would use a drop of blood from a finger prick to detect the AIDS virus.     The company stressed that there is no assurance it will succeed in develop ths test, nor in obtaining government approval for marketing such as test.      Reuter &#3;
