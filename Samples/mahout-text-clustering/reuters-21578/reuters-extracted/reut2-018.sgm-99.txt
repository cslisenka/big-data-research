PROXMIRE SAYS VOLCKER RETIREMENT A LOSS FOR U.S.

Senate Banking Committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, said Paul Volcker's decision to leave the Federal Reserve Board was a loss for the country.     "I think it is a serious loss for the country," Proxmire said in a Senate speech. He had no comment on the nomination of Alan Greespan to replace Volcker.     Proxmire's committee will hold confirmation hearings on Greenspan, but no date has been scheduled.     "Mr Volcker has been a superb chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He has the confidence of the business community. He has the confidence of the country. And I thought he had the confidence of the Administration. We are going to miss him very much."  Reuter &#3;
