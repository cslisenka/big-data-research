U.S. HOUSE PASSES TRUTH IN SAVINGS ACT

The House of Representatives passed a bill that requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of interest rates they offer on savings accounts.     Institutions would be required to disclose through advertisments and announcements the minimum balances, time requirements, fees and other conditions of their savings accounts, certificates of deposits and interest-bearing checking accounts.         The purpose of the bill is to help customers decide which banks and savings associations offer the best rates, according to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat.     The bill was passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate.  Reuter &#3;
