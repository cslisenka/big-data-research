NORWEGIANS MAY HAVE SOLD MORE COMPUTERS TO USSR

The Norwegian company <Konsgberg Vaapenfabrikk> (KV) may have sold more high technology defence equipment since an original deal in 1982, senior justice officials said.     State prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch told Reuters he had started fresh investigations into the state-owned arms firm which delivered computers to the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1983, used to make near-silent submarine propellers.     "There may have been other deliveries of the same equipment since then," he said.  Reuter &#3;
