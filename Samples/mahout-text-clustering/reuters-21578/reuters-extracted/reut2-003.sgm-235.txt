WEAREVER <WRPS> TO RELOCATE HEADQUARTERS

WearEver-ProctorSilex Inc said it will relocate is corporate headquarters from Chillicothe to Richmond, Va., beginning this fall and ending by early 1988.     The company said Richmond was chosen because it is centrally located to its main operating facilities, which will reduce travel and other costs.     About 150 headquarters employees will be offered the chance to relocate, the company said. WearEver's cookware plant in Chillicothe will not be moved, and its sales and marketing offices will remain in Englewood, N.J.  Reuter &#3;
