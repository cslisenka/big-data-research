PROJECTIONS SHOW SWISS VOTERS WANT TRIED PARTIES

The prospect of a dominant alliance of socialists and environmentalists ended as the Social Democrats became the biggest losers in Swiss parliamentary elections.     Projections by Swiss radio show the ruling centre-right alliance of Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and the People Party will likely hold on to power.     Less than 48 pct of voters cast a ballot, a record low turnout. The moderate left-of-centre Social Democrats lost six of its previous 47 seats. The Green Party of Switzerland won 11 seats in the 200-seat lower house, a rise of eight. But the Green Alliance and other green groupings lost one seat.     The Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and People Party are forecast to hold 159 seats, down seven from the last election in 1983, and 42 of the 46 seats in the upper house, down one.     The projections showed the centre-right Radical Democrats dropping four seats to 50 in the lower house, although they would remain the largest party.     The conservative Christian Democrats were seen losing one seat to 41, while the right-wing People's Party, despite forecast losses, added four to their previous 23 seats.  REUTER &#3;
