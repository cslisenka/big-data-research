FRENCH DEBT FELL TO 398.2 BILLION FRANCS END-1986

French medium and long-term debt fell to 398.2 billion francs at end-1986 from 419.6 billion at end-September and 464.7 billion at end-1985, the Finance Ministry said.     The 66.5 billion franc reduction over the full year mainly reflected a 44.8 billion difference between debt redemption and new foreign borrowings, it said.     The 21.4 billion franc reduction in the fourth quarter mainly reflected an 11.4 billion franc difference between redemptions and new borrowing, the ministry added.     The balance reflected revisions to the previous figures, and the impact of the currency fluctuations on the French franc value of foreign currency denominated borrowings, it said.     Expressed in dollar terms, medium and long-term debt fell to 62.7 billion dlrs at end-1986 from 63.4 billion at end-September.     The ministry said although the dollar's depreciation favoured a reduction in foreign debt, this was largely offset by the appreciation of other currencies in which 63 pct of French medium and long term debts were denominated at end-1986.     While the dollar remained the main borrowing currency, accounting for 37 pct of medium and long-term debt, the mark accounted for 11.5 pct, the European Currency Unit 10.8 pct, the yen 9.4 pct, the Eurofranc 8.7 pct, the Swiss franc 7.3 pct, the Guilder 4.6 pct, sterling 3.7 pct and seven pct others.     Taking into account external lending, net foreign debt fell to 81.5 billion francs at end-1986 from 106.7 billion at end-September and 153.7 billion at end-1985.     External lending, comprising export credits of more than one year maturity, and public sector foreign loans, were estimated at about 316.7 billion francs at end-1986 against 312.9 mln at end-September.     Total foreign medium and long-term debt included seven billion francs of direct state debt at end 1986, reduced from 15.6 billion three months earlier, the ministry said.  REUTER &#3;
