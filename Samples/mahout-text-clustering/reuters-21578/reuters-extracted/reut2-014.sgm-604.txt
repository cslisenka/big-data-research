WALL STREET CLOSE SHARPLY LOWER

Wall Street's fears about interest rates and inflation were reignited today, triggering a sharp selloff in active trading. Profit taking and arbitrage related sell programs, taking a cue from falling bond prices, combined to pound the market sharply lower.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which soared 85 points to record levels in the past two sessions, tumbled 45 points to close at 2361 today. It was the fourth biggest decline in the market's history. Declines led advances three-one as volume rose to 188 mln shares from the 174 mln that traded on Monday.  Reuter &#3;
