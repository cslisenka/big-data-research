SECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT

House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions, before considering the issue, a staff member said.     In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.     Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.     The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax. However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.     Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17 billion dlrs a year, the aide said.     The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities transactions."     NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement, "Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide and would be counter-productive, making America's securities industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time when financial markets are becoming increasingly international."
