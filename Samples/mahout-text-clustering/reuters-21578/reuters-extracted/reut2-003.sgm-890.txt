OKLAHOMA BANKING CHIEF WILL APPEAL CHARGE

State Banking Commissioner Robert Empie, ordered removed from office in an alleged insider trading scheme, plans to fight the charges, an aide said today.     "There will be a hearing on the allegations," a spokeswoman said, when Empie returns from a meeting outside the state.     Governor Henry Bellmon yesterday issued an executive order removing Empie from office "by reason of his incompetence, malfeasance and neglect of duty."     Bellmon said Empie held or controlled more than 50,000 shares of stock in United Oklahoma Bank, a firm whose assets he regulated. He said the commisssioner used "information available to him only by reason of his position as commissioner to determine when to sell or attempt to sell shares of stock."     The order gave Empie 20 days to request a hearing, something his aide indicated he planned to do. In the meantime he was suspended from office.     "Empie intentionally misled the state of Oklahoma into believing that he had removed hmself from any potential conflict of interest by placing the ... shares in a so-called blind trust beyond his control, when in fact Empie continued to be infomred of the assets in the trust and the value of those assest and remained in control of their disposition, as shown by his transfer of the shares on or about December 23, 1985," Bellmon said.
