FCC EASES RULE FOR CABLE TV FIRMS ON SWITCH

The Federal Communications Commission voted at a meeting to ease a requirement that cable television firms must provide a signal-selector switch free of charge to all customers.     The so-called A/B switch is attached to a television set and permits a viewer to turn from cable programs to over-the-air broadcast stations which cable companies must carry.     After the rule was criticized the FCC changed it so that cable firms would have to provide the switch only if a customer requested it and could charge a fee.  Reuter &#3;
