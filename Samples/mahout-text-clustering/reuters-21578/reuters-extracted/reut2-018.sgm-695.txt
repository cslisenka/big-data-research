OLSTEN CORP <OLS> MAKES EXCHANGE OFFER FOR STOCK

Olsten Corp <OLS> said it has begun an offer to exchange on a share-for-share basis shares of newly authorized Class B common shares for existing common stock.     The company said the new Class B will contain limited dividend rights and have 10 votes rather than one vote per share for the common stock.     It also said the new stock will not have a trading market, will be subject to significant restrictions on its transfer, will be entitled through 1989 to no more than 80 pct of the cash dividends on the common stock and will be convertible into common stock at any time.     The company said it does not recommend that shareholdrs other than chairman and chief executive William Olsten and his family tender their common for exchange.     The offer will expire July 16.
