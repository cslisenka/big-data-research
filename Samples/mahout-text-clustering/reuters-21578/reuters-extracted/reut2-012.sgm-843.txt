DATA COORDINATION TO PLAY ROLE AT IMF, STOLTENBERG

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said international coordination of economic and financial policies as well as of economic indicators will be discussed at next week's meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington.

Progress made by senior government officials in this sphere would be discussed at the IMF meeting and results would later be presented at this year's economic summit in Venice.  REUTER &#3;
