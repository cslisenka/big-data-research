COURT VACATES LIBEL AWARD IN MOBIL CASE

A U.S. appeals court threw out a two mln dlr libel award against The Washington Post for an article that said former Mobil Corp president William Tavoulareas set up his son in a shipping firm that did business with Mobil.     The article said Tavoulareas had used his influence to set up his son, Peter, in 1974 as a partner in the London-based Atlas Maritime Co, a shipping company whose business included a multi-million dollar contract with Mobil.     "We are convinced that ... the 'set up' allegation was substantially true," the appeals court said in the 7-1 ruling.     The Tavoulareases said the 1979 article by the Post's investigative reporter, Patrick Tyler, was false and that it embarrassed them and held them up to ridicule.  Reuter &#3;
