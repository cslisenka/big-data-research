HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK CONTRA AID FOR SIX MONTHS

The House voted to block 40 mln dlrs in military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan accounts for past assistance, including money diverted from the U.S. sale of arms to Iran.     The vote was seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has made aid to the "contras" a key initiative.     Congressional Democratic leaders have conceded that despite today's vote, they can not muster a two-thirds majority to override a certain Reagan veto. But they have said it is likely they can win a battle expected this fall over 105 mln dlrs iin new aid Reagan is requesting.                Reuter &#3;
