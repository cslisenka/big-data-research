FDA RECALL MONSANTO<MCT> UNIT ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE

The Food and Drug Administration said Monsanto Co's <MCT> G.D. Searle and Co unit is voluntarily recalling all lots of its Gynex oral contraceptives.     The FDA said some of the blister-pack cards that house the birth contol pills may contain out of sequence tablets in the 28-day-cycle package. It said other 21-day-cycle packages may be missing some tablets.     If oral contraceptives are taken in the wrong order or skipped, the likelihood of pregancy increases.     The FDA said said the recall affects 315,000 packages of the pills which were distributed nationwide since the drug was first distributed in February.     The FDA said Searle believes only a small number of pacakges, about 2,000 to 3,000, were dispensed to consumers.     The FDA also said the labeling on the product indicates that Gynex oral contraceptives are manufactured and packaged by Corona Pharmaceutical of Corona, Calif., for G.D. Searle and Co.  Reuter &#3;
