PERLE QUITS AS PENTAGON ARMS CONTROL EXPERT

Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle resigned to complete work on a novel and said he was confident the United States and Soviet Union were headed for a verifiable arms control agreement.     Perle, 45, one of the most outspoken and controversial critics in the Reagan administration of past superpower weapons treaties, told reporters he would continue to do consulting work for the government on arms control.     "I'm leaving in order to do other things, including finish negotiations (with publishers) on my novel. I also plan to do some other writing," said Perle.  Reuter &#3;
