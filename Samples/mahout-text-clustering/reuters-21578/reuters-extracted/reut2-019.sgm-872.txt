FIRST PENNSYLVANIA <FBA> TO LAUNCH NEW VISA CARD

First Pennsylvania Bank N.A., the major subsidiary of First Pennsylvania Corp, said it will add a variable-rate <VISA> card to its consumer credit product line.     The bank said the card carries a 14 pct annual interest rate that is guaranteed through Sept 30, after which time the interest rate will increase or decrease if there is a change in the prime rate as reflected in the Wall Street Journal.     There is no grace period for purchases made with card, but First Pennsylvania already offers a <MasterCard> product with a 25-day grace period, the bank added.  Reuter &#3;
