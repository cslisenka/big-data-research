S/P AFFIRMS RATINGS ON ATT <T> DEBT

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed the ratings on seven billion dlrs of debt and preferred stock of American Telephone and Telegraph Co.     It said that despite flat revenues, ATT's interexchange business and strong cash flow should sustain the current level of debtholder protection for the next several years.     But ATT's overall competitive risk continues to grow as it extends beyond its traditional business area, S and P noted. Affirmed were ATT's AA debentures and preferred stock and A-1-plus commercial paper, and Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co's AA debt which ATT assumed at divestiture.  Reuter &#3;
