EC SHELVES LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THREE AIRLINES

The European Community Commission said today it has shelved threatened legal action against West Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.F>, Alitalia of Italy <AERI.MI> and Olympic Airways of Greece after they agreed to change practices that restrict competition in the heavily-protected EC sector.     The Commission had also written to seven other Community airlines, including British Airways <BAB.L> and Air France, last summer warning them that agreements such as capacity and revenue sharing accords broke EC competition rules. The seven have already agreed to hold talks with the Commission on bringing such practices into line with the rules.     In a statement, the EC's executive authority also spelled out tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks on liberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares, warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused to comply.     As a first step, the Commission wanted the 10 carriers to eliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused by the current practices and agreements.     The latest demands go further towards liberalisation than proposals that are currently the subject of difficult negotiations between by EC Transport Ministers. REUTER &#3;
