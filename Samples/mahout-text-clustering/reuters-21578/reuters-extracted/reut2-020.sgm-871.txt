FEMALE FRUIT FLY MAY LEAD TO CALIFORNIA SPRAYING

The discovery of a fertile female Mediterranean fruit fly in a backyard apple tree may lead to aerial spraying in Orange County, California State Department of Agriculture officials said.     California Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Gera Curry said more than 1,700 traps have been set in an 80-square mile area around the Westminster neighborhood following the discovery. The fly was found in a trap routinely checked by agriculture officials.     Curry said if aerial spraying is used, it would be one-time spray, unlike the nightly sprayings used in 1980.
