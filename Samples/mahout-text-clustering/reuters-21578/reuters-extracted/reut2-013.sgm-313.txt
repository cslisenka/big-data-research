KUALA LUMPUR TIN PRICE CLOSES UNCHANGED

The Kuala Lumpur tin price closed unchanged from yesterday's 16.65 ringgit per kilo close after a very brief trading session, dealers said.     Buyers and sellers were evenly matched at the opening level of 16.65 ringgit, and total turnover was 103 tonnes against 135 yesterday, they added.     Buying at this level was mainly noted from the Japan, local and Europe, again influenced by steady currency factors, despite an easier European spot market.     Some cash-strapped miners continued to sell, they said.  REUTER &#3;
