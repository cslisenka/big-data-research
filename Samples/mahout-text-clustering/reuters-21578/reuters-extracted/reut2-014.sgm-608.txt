CANADA STOCKS CLOSE LOWER ON PROFIT TAKING

Toronto stocks, higher at midsession, closed lower as a bout of profit taking on Wall Street spilled over to Canadian markets, analysts said.

The 300-share composite index soared 139 points in the last three sessions.     "By and large, we had a good dose of profit taking today," Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst John Ing commented.
