FIRST MISSISSIPPI <FRM> MAY REPURCHASE STOCK

First Mississippi Corp said in view of the recent decline in its stock price due to the drop in the stock market, it is considering a repurchase of its common stock.     The company did not say how many shares it would repurchase but said that it has about 13 mln dlrs available for such actions.     The company also said its first quarter earnings, to be released next week, will be substantially better than the 33 cts per share last year.         Results will also include a gain of about 44 cts per share from the sale of a portion of the company's interest in Melamine Chemicals, the company said.     The company said its plan for corporate restructuring is proceeding on schedule and that proceeds from the 49 mln dlr coal supply contract settlement with <Tampa Electric Co> have been received and will be used to reduce debt.     First Mississippi is a diversified resource company.  Reuter &#3;
