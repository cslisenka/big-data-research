VOLCKER SEES BENEFIT IN FDIC/FSLIC MERGER

Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said a combination of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, FSLIC, could be contemplated in the longer term but is not an answer to the thrift industry's immediate problems.     "I don't think it's an answer to 1977 or 1988," Volcker said at a press conference.     But a merger of the two deposit-insurance agencies could be an option as part of a general structural reform of the U.S. banking system.     The aim of a merger would not be for commercial banks to subsidize ailing savings and loan associations but to improve official oversight of depository institutions, Volcker said.     "The attractive element is that you get almost by definition a consistency of supervision and regulation that you don't have now," he explained.  Reuter &#3;
