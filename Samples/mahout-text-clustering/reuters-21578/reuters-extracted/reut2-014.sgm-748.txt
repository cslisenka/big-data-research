TEXAS MAY CONSIDER INCOME TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES

The State of Texas, faced with a record 5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may have to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.      Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when the state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily allowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate income tax.      However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only sent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into the state's tax revenues.     Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cut their credit ratings of the state to double A from the top triple A in early March.     Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was the first time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding the report noted that while "the Legislature is now considering proposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for full recovery are weak."     With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State Comptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapple with a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8 billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No other state in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.     "There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five years ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature would institute an income tax," said George Bland, Assistant Professor of Political Science at North Texas State University, adding, "Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it's coming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."      State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally supplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.     However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent years, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.      Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major factor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income tax is.     John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based Texas Research League said, "There is a great deal of popular sentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor Clements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."     However, he said that since the oil price fall the state faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or broadening and possibly raising the sales tax.     Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise at Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes, said he favored reforming the present tax system to take account of the changed structure of the economy.     "We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries, manufacturing and high-tech," Pejovich said.     Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock said, "Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the Legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything else, that's the only option."     Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming      For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled that the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr deficit into the next biennium, even though the state consitution requires a balanced budget. But as State Treasurer Ann Richards said last Thursday, "Jim Mattox's decision today turns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not think that the goose isn't still cooking."     Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending cuts. But the state is already under pressure from a Federal District Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.     And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accused the state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier this year, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial restraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning plans to require teachers to take competency tests.     Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission next year to "study alternative revenue sources," with an income tax being instituted as early as January 1989.     "If the political leaders are educated about (the effects of the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift toward income tax," he said.                   Reuter &#3;
