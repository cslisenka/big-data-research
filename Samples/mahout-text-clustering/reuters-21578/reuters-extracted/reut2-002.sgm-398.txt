GM <GM> TO OFFER AIRBAGS, WANTS RULES RELAXED

General Motors Corp said it plans to offer driver-side airbags as standard equipment on 500,000   cars in the 1990 model year and up to three mln by 1992 if a federal safety rule is relaxed for domestic automakers.     A GM spokesman said the statement comes in advance of a congressional hearing tomorrow in Washington on a proposed extension of a federal deadline for installation of "automatic occupant protection systems" on all cars beyond the current September, 1989, target.     GM previously said it would offer airbags as optional equipment on its 1988-model Oldsmobile Delta 88 models.      Reuter &#3;
