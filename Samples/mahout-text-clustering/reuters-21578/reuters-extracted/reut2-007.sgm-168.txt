ACCOUNTING GROUP SETS COMPUTER COST GUIDELINES

The National Association of Accountants said it has a set of guidelines to account for costs from internal use of computers.     The Association said Statement No. 4F, written by the Management Accounting Practices Committee, advises that users generally should be charged for services furnished by an information system.     The Association said users can measure internal computing costs against costs charged by outside vendors. But it said a company may not want to allocate costs when attempting to encourage use of a new system.   Reuter &#3;
