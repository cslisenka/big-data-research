PIRELLI SAYS YEAR RESULT CLOUDED BY WORLD OUTLOOK

Pirelli Spa <PIRI.MI> said its full-year results for 1987 would depend on the world economic situation, now clouded by the possibility of a recession.     It said strong demand in the cable and tire sectors contributed to improved sales and profits in the first six months of 1987.     The group said in a statement that the cable sector showed sustained demand in the first six months of the year, particularly in Italy, Spain and Argentina. It said cable sales in the U.S. Market remained weak, however.  Reuter &#3;
