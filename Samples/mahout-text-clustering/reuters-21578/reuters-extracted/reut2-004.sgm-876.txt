ZENITH <ZEN> GETS APPROVAL FOR GENERIC KEFLEX

Zenith Laboratories Inc said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to market Cephalexin, an antibiotic that is the generic version of Eli Lilly Inc's <LLY> Keflex.     Generic drugs are low-cost copies of brand name drugs that have lost their patents. Keflex's patent expires April 21. Analysts said four generic drug companies, including Zenith, will have approval to market generic Keflex this year.     Analysts said Keflex is Lilly's second leading drug product, with 1986 worldwide sales of about 335 mln dlrs. In 1986 Lilly had sales of 3.7 billion dlrs.     "We think that in the first year that it loses its patent, U.S. sales of Keflex will drop to about 240 mln dlrs from 280 mln dlrs," said Joe Riccardo, associate director of Bear Stearns.     Riccardo said Lilly would offset the loss with sales from Humatrope, a genetically engineered human growth hormone recently approved for marketing in the U.S.     He also said it was likely that Lilly would get U.S. FDA marketing approval this year for Prozac, a drug for treating clinical depression that also shows promise in weight reduction.
