PAKISTAN GETS 70 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN

mln-dlr, 20-year loan to assist Pakistan in a project designed to improve power plant efficiency.     Noting that a shortage of power constrains Pakistan's economic development, the Bank said one objective of the project is to provide at least 200 megawatts of additional generating capacity.     Another objective is to improve the efficiency with which hydrocarbons are used by Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in power production, it said. One effect of this would be reduced atmospheric pollution.  Reuter &#3;
