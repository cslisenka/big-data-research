SUPER VALU <SVU> SETS LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING

Super Valu Stores Inc said its capital budget for the fiscal year beginning March One is 330 mln dlrs.     It said it spent 363.7 mln dlrs last year, primarily because the previous year's budget included funding for such major projects as completely new distribution centers.     It said the current budget provides for significant additions to a number of its new distribution centers, for upgrades in computer equipment, for 10 new ShopKo stores and 70 mln dlrs in financing for the company's independent retailer customers.
