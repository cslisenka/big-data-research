J. HARDIE SAYS HIGHER NET REFLECTS RATIONALISATION

James Hardie Industries Ltd <HAHA.S> said the 28 pct increase in its 1986/87 net profit reflected the benefits of continuing rationalisation and consolidation of Australian activities and expansion in the U.S.     The diversified building products group reported net earnings rose to 60.58 mln dlrs in the year ended March 31 from 47.42 mln in 1985/86. It lifted annual dividend to 24 cents from 22 with a final of 13, against 11 previously.     Hardie had concentrated resources on building up its core businesses of building products, paper merchanting and technology and services, it said in a statement.     Hardie said it sold a number of businesses during the year which were unable to meet objectives for return on investment or market share and some non-core units.     This resulted in a decline in sales to 1.50 billion dlrs from 1.56 billion, but also contributed to a fall of about 100 mln dlrs in borrowings by year-end and a 36 pct drop in interest expense to 29.16 mln dlrs, it said.     Hardie said a 42 pct jump in second-half net earnings to 29.66 mln dlrs from 20.92 mln a year earlier was particularly pleasing in view of the difficult trading conditions faced by the building products businesses in Australia.     The problems in U.S. Irrigation operations which adversely affected 1985/86 earnings have been overcome, Hardie said.     It said the process of rationalisation and consolidation had continued into the current year as had expansion into the U.S.     Hardie said it could now look forward to a period of development and further growth in Australia and overseas after carrying through a long and expensive process of eliminating asbestos, the group's original prime raw material, from its fibre cement building products over the past eight years.
