WYERHAEUSER <WY> FILES TO OFFER PREFERENCE STOCK

Weyerhaeuser Co said it has filed for an offering of four mln shares of convertible exchangeable preference shares through underwriter Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>.     The company said the preference shares will be convertible at any time into common shares, and on any dividend payment date starting June 15, 1990, the company may exchange all the preference shares for convertible subordinated debentures due 2017.      The company said the preference shares will not be redeemable before June 15, 1989 unless the closing price equals or exceeds 150 pct of the then-effective conversion price per share for at least 20 trading days within a 30 consecutive trading day period that ends within five trading days before issuance of a notice of redemption.     Weyerhaeuser said proceeds will be used to reduce outstanding commercial paper, although initially they may be invested in marketable securities.  Reuter &#3;
