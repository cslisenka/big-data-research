MELLON BANK <MEL> CHAIRMAN RETIRES

Mellon Bank Corp said J. David Barnes has retired as chairman and chief executive officer and resigned from the board of the company and its Mellon Bank subsidiary.     The company said senior director Nathan W. Pearson will succeed Barnes but also appointed a special search committee to review all internal and external candidates for chairman.     Mellon said "Mr. Barnes felt a change of management at this time would help the bank move more quickly and with less constraint in meeting the needs of shareholders, customers and employees."     Pearson is 75 and is financial advisor to the Paul Mellon Family Interests. Barnes is 57.     On Friday Mellon reported a 59.8 mln dlr first quarter loss. It had placed 310 mln dlrs of Brazilian loans on a nonaccrual basis and said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 35 cts per share from 69 cts due to energy, foreign, commercial real estate and heavy industry loans.
