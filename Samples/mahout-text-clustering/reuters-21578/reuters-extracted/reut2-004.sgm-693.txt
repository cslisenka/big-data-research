 FRANCE EXPECTS TO SIGN DISNEYLAND CONTRACT BY NEXT MONTH

The French government and Walt Disney Co  <DIS.N> expect to sign a contract for Europe's first Disneyland amusement park before the end of next month, a senior French official said today.     The complex, to be built 20 miles east of Paris, will include a so-called "Magic Kingdom" theme park, outdoor recreation, shops and hotels.     Initial investment by Walt Disney and a group of French and other investors has been put at around eight billion francs for the project's central theme park.     A preliminary agreement was reached in December 1985.  REUTER &#3;
