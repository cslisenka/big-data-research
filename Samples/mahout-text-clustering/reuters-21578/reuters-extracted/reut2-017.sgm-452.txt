TOSHIBA HOPES EXPORTS TO U.S. NOT HURT

A senior Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> executive said he hoped the alleged illegal export of high technology equipment to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba subsidiary would not hurt the parent company's exports to the U.S.     Toshiba's 50-pct subsidiary <Toshiba Machine Co Ltd> "is a completely independent company with independent management," Toshiba Corp senior vice-president Osamu Iemura told a press conference.     "We want to have that fact understood overseas," he said.     Iemura said he had no information to suggest the U.S. Defence Department had broken off talks with Toshiba on the possible procurement of lap top computers because of the illegal exports by Toshiba Machine.     Kyodo News Agency, quoting the weekly magazine U.S. News and World Report, said on Saturday the U.S. Air Force had decided to cancel an agreement to buy 100 mln dlrs worth of computers because of Toshiba Machine's illegal exports.     "We have no contract. The U.S. Defence Department has been negotiating for procurement with several companies including Toshiba," Iemura said.     Last week, police said they had arrested two Toshiba Machine employees on suspicion of illegally exporting high technology equipment to the Soviet Union.     The Japanese government has already banned further shipments of goods to Communist states by Toshiba Machine for one year and by its export agency C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T> for three months.
