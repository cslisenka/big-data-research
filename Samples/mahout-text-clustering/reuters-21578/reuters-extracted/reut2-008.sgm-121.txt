ISRAELI JETS RAID SOUTH LEBANON

Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets in south Lebanon for the second time in four days, Lebanese security sources said.     They said the planes attacked targets in the Darb al-Sim area a few kms east of Sidon.     Israeli planes carried out a similar raid in the same area on Friday, hitting two buildings used by guerrillas loyal to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.  REUTER &#3;
