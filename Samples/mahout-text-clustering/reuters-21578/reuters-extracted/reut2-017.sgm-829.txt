MOODY'S AFFIRMS MIDDLE SOUTH <MSU> AND UNITS

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it affirmed about four billion dlrs of long-term debt of Middle South Utilities and nearly all of its units.     Moody's cited the U.S. Supreme Court's stay of an adverse Misssissippi Supreme Court ruling for a Middle South unit, Mississippi Power and Light Co. The approval of the stay may enhance Mississippi Power's prospects for a favorable judgment, Moody's added.     But Moody's said it will watch the situation closely because the stay depends on a bond posting that is satisfactory to the Mississippi Supreme Court.     On May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission ordered Mississippi Power to stop collecting about 12 mln dlrs in monthly revenues from its Grand Gulf power plant, Moody's pointed out. The Commission also wants Mississippi Power to submit a plan for refunding 190 mln dlrs of previously collected funds, Moody's said.     The first mortgage bonds and secured pollution control bonds of Mississippi Power, Arkansas Power and Louisiana Power and Light Co were affirmed at Baa-1. Their preferred stock was affirmed at Baa-2. In addition, Moody's affirmed Mississippi Power's Baa-2 unsecured pollution control debt.   Reuter &#3;
