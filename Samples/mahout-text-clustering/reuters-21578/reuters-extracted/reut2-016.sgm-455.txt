AEQUITRON <AQTN> WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT DISMISSED

Aequitron Medical Inc said that a wrongful death suit in which the company was named as a defendant has been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by the plaintiffs.     The suit, asking one mln dlrs in damages, was originally filed in U.S. district court in Atlanta in August 1986, it said. It alleged that the defective performance of an Aequitron respiration and heart rate monitor resulted in the death of an infant in October 1985.     Under terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs released their rights to any further legal proceedings against Aequitron, it said.     In return, Aequitron said it agreed to release the plaintiffs from any claims for costs or attorneys fees.     "The dismissal with prejudice, and the plaintiffs' retraction of all claims against Aequitron, support our original contention that this suit was without merit," the company said.  Reuter &#3;
