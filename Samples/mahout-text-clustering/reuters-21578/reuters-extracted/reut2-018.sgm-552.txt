BRITAIN PULLS OUT MORE DIPLOMATS FROM IRAN

Britain withdrew four more diplomats from its diplomatic mission in Tehran, leaving only two officials in their posts.     The Foreign Office said the four had left Tehran earlier today and would arrive in London tomorrow.     Britain and Iran have been embroiled in a three-week-old diplomatic row which began when a British diplomat was beaten and abducted for 24 hours in the Iranian capital.-  Reuter &#3;
