LUMBER FUTURES TRIM LOSSES AT CLOSE

Lumber futures recovered from lows to close 3.10 to 0.10 dlrs per tbf lower. May paced the setback and ended at 187.70 dlrs.     Futures moved lower all morning on long liquidation. Stop loss orders added to the setback before late shortcovering trimmed losses, traders said.     Pressure reflected declines in financial futures, which prompted concern that interest rates may rise, and private reports of further weakness in cash product. Demand for spruce is slow and mills are looking for buyers, they noted.     Shearson, Merrill, Shatkin, Dean Witter and Cargill sold on the decline. Merchants spread long May/short September at one time, they added.  Reuter &#3;
