WAREHOUSE CLUB <WCLB.O> MAY LOWER RESERVES

Warehouse Club Inc said it subleased two Chicago locations closed in April and is reviewing the five mln dlr second quarter reserve established to cover the cost of the closures.     The company told Reuters it will probably remove two to three mln dlrs of the total reserve amount which will result in higher third quarter profits.     In the 1986 quarter, Warehouse Club had net loss of 891,000 dlrs or 13 cents a share on sales of 41.4 mln dlrs.     The company said it will achieve a profit in the third quarter despite any reduction in the reserve.  Reuter &#3;
