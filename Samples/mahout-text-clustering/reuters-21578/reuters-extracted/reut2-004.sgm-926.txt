LIFFE EXECUTIVE GREETS SEC MOVE ON FUTURES TRADE

A decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to remove a key regulatory obstacle to trading foreign debt futures on U.S. Exchanges was a constructive development, London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) Chief Executive Michael Jenkins said.     The SEC yesterday agreed to remove the regulation against trading futures in designated foreign government debt securities on markets not located in the issuing country.     Jenkins said the decision cleared the way for the Chicago Board of Trade possibly to trade U.K. Long gilt futures and a Japanese yen bond contract.     The CBOT is now likely to proceed with an application to trade gilts to the Commodity Futures Trading Commmission (CFTC), he said.  Reuter &#3;
