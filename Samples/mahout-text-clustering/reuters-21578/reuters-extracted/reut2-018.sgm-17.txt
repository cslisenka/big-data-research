DOMINION <D> UNIT SELLS 30-YEAR BONDS

Virginia Electric and Power Co, a unit of Dominion Resources Inc, is raising 100 mln dlrs via an offering of first and refunding mortgage bonds due 2017 yielding 9.89 pct, said sole manager E.F. Hutton and Co Inc.     Hutton led a group that won the bonds in competitive bidding. It bid them at 99.376, representing a net interest charge to the company of 9.94 pct.     The underwriter set a 9-7/8 pct coupon and reoffering price of 99.85 to yield 123 basis points more than comparable Treasury securities. Non-refundable for five years, the bonds are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard and Poor's.     The gross spread is four dlrs and the reallowance is 2.50 dlrs, bookrunner Hutton said of the Virginia Electric deal.     Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market in October 1986 when it sold 100 mln dlrs of same-rated, same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. That issue was priced to yield 9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.  Reuter &#3;
