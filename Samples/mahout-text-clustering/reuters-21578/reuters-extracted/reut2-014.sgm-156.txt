KANSAS CITY WHEAT MARGINALLY FIRMER AT MIDDAY

Hard wheat futures traded 1/4 cent higher to steady in light midsession trading as firm Chicago wheat futures and hopes for new export sales this week lent support, traders said. May stood 1/4 cent higher at 2.74 dlrs.     Trading was light with little fresh direction in the market. Traders awaited results on Jordan's Export Bonus tender for hard wheat and Egypt's tender this week for flour.     Staley bought July and the July/December spread traded at 7-1/2 cents, pit brokers said.  Reuter &#3;
