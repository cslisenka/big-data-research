THOUSANDS STAGE STRIKES IN EASTERN YUGOSLAVIA

About 10,000 workers have gone on strike in eastern Yugoslavia during the past few days demanding higher wages, the official Tanjug news agency said.     It said about 20 strikes broke out in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, triggered by falling incomes and minimum wages. More than 600 workers in the Visokogradnja construction firm at Titograd left their jobs because they had not been paid for three months, Tanjug said.     Yugoslavia has been hit by a wave of strikes after the government introduced a pay freeze in February to try to stem wage rises and almost 100 pct inflation.     Tanjug said the majority of the strikes in Montenegro were in loss making companies whose weaknesses would have led to unrest even if a wages freeze had not been implemented.  Reuter &#3;
