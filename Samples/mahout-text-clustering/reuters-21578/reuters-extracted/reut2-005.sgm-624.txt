MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE CONSECO <CNC> DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade Conseco Inc's 100 mln dlrs of debt.     The rating agency cited Conseco's proposal to acquire Western National Life Insurance Co from Beneficial Corp <BNL>. Moody's said its review would focus on the financing of the deal, which will increase Conseco's size from 650 mln dlrs in assets to about 2.7 billion dlrs.     Moody's will also study the adequacy of projected earnings and cash flow from Western National in relation to the financing plan. Conseco currently carries B-1 senior subordinated debentures and convertible debt.  Reuter &#3;
