SENATORS, PROSECUTOR DISAGREE ON IRAN TESTIMONY

Senators and a special prosecutor were in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quick answers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.     Senators on a special Senate committee investigating the scandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution to force early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and John Poindexter.     North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide President Reagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iran arms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter, who was NSC director and North's boss, resigned the same day.      The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexter was ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the funds diversion, contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it.     Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a special House committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for North and Poindexter for at least 90 days, and would make the same request to the Senate committee today.     Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delay granting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.     Walsh, whose job is to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted for criminal misconduct, said premature immunity could put the three beyond the law before a grand jury can decide whether they should be prosecuted.
