VW AFFAIR COULD DELAY SHARE SALE - STOLTENBERG

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was quoted as saying a possible currency fraud at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> may affect government plans to sell its 20 pct stake in the carmaker this year.     "It is all very unpleasant for us because we have decided to privatise the VW shares this year. We will now have to ask ourselves the question whether we can keep to this date," he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview.     Bild am Sonntag released the text ahead of publication     Stoltenberg did not elaborate on the share sale. The West German government owns 20 pct of VW ordinary share capital and has said previously it plans to sell it either in 1987 or 1988.     Stoltenberg told Bild am Sonntag the possible fraud showed there had "clearly been reprehensible criminal conduct below the level of the responsible management board."     "I do not want to prejudge results but the immediate and serious question which poses itself is whether certain management board members have kept their areas of business under appropriate control," he was quoted as saying.     VW said last week it had discovered possibly fraudulent currency transactions which could cost the company 480 mln marks and had asked state prosecutors to investigate.     It said on Friday it had dismissed the head of its foreign exchange department, Burkhard Junger.     VW also said it suspended six staff, including financial transfer department chief Guenther Borchert and the head of the central cash and currency clearing department, Siegfried Mueller.
