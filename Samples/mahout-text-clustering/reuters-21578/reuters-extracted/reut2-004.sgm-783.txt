WALKER TELECOMMUNICATIONS <WTEL> CLOSING UNIT

Walker Telecommunications Corp said it discontinued operations of its mobile communication division, resulting in an undisclosed one time substantial loss for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 1986.     Howard Lassler, president, said the company intends to focus management and other resources during 1987 on its telephone systems division, and on developing new projects for its mutual signal corp subsidiary.     The company said dropping retail prices resulted in the mobile division no longer being able to make a profit.  Reuter &#3;
