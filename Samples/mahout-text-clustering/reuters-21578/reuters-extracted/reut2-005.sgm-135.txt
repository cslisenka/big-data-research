CANADIAN BANKER SAYS BRAZIL ECONOMIC GROWTH VITAL

William Mulholland, president of the Bank of Montreal, said here it is important for Brazil to seek its economic growth.     Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, the Canadian banker said he suggested to Funaro the conversion of Brazil's 1.3 billion dollars debt with the Bank of Montreal by direct investments in this country.     He said the Brazilian minister was impressed with his initiative and that he (Funaro) had submitted the proposal to the Central Bank for a broader analysis.     Commenting on Brazil's decision to suspend payment of interests to private creditor banks, Mulholland said he would rather see that it did not happen, but that he understood the decision made by the Brazilian government:     "A country like Brazil cannot stop growing. Of course, it must also seek an internal adjustment capable of controlling the spiral of its inflation and public deficit," he said.     He suggested Brazil and the international financial community to work together and seek stable conditions to face the problems of this country's foreign debt.                   Reuter &#3;
