N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES FINISH HIGHER

Platinum futures finished higher as  the metal continued to follow the strong silver market, analysts said.     The key July platinum delivery settled at 572.20 dlrs an ounce, up 3.60 dlrs but below a session high of 577.50 dlrs. Other months gained 3.70 to 4.60 dlrs.     However, steady trade selling and skittish speculators kept platinum well below session highs. "Most metals players are in the silver pit, not here," said one floor analyst.     Meanwhile, palladium ended 25 to 50 cts firmer, but also under the day's highs, in sympathy.  Reuter &#3;
