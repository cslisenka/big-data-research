ELECTROLUX AND GILLETTE IN JOINT VENTURE

The Gillette Company <GS.N> and Sweden's Electrolux AB <ELUX.ST> said they would form a partnership to commercialise a new technology developed by the U.S. Firm which uses solar cells to generate electricity.     Electrolux is interested in harnessing the technology to produce portable domestic appliances and will provide capital and development contracts for the joint venture.     The two companies are to establish a laboratory outside Boston to develop what are known as thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline into light and electricity through the use of solar cells.
