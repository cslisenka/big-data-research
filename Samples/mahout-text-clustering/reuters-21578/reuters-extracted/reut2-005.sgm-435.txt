MAGNA <MAGAF> CREATES NEW COSMA UNIT

Magna International Inc said it created a new wholly owned unit, Cosma International Inc, to design, develop and coordinate production from Magna's 27 auto part stamping and related facilities in Canada and the United States.     Cosma is expected to have 1987 sales of more than 400 mln dlrs and the company projects future sales will "increase very rapidly," a Magna spokesman said. Cosma will also raise its own capital through an equity issue in about 18 months, spokesman Jerry Barker said, responding to a query. Terms of the issue have not been set, he added.     Magna said it established the Cosma unit to make the company's extensive stamping operations more responsive to the needs of North American automakers.     The Cosma unit will be centered on its Bramalea, Ontario stamping facility, which manufactures car bodies for American Motors Corp <AMO>'s Premier model.  Reuter &#3;
