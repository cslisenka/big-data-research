MOODY'S CONTINUES REVIEW OF TEXAS AIR <TEX> UNIT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said the debt ratings of People Express Airlines Inc remain under review for possible downgrade.     The agency said that People Express has not legally merged with Continental Airlines Inc, a unit of Texas Air Corp, even though the two have integrated their flight operations. Moody's also cited significant litigation against People.     Moody's pointed out that neither Texas Air nor Continental have assumed the debt service obligations of People Express, which currently carries B-3 senior secured debt and Caa senior unsecured debt.
