GREENSPAN CUTS SHORT SCHEDULED DALLAS TRIP

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan cut short a scheduled trip to Dallas and is returning to Washington to moniter events, a Federal Reserve spokesman said.     Greenspan had been scheduled to speak to the American Bankers Association, which is meeting in Dallas, but canceled the engagement, the spokesman said. He also canceled a speech scheduled for this evening to a New York University group, the spokesman said.     The spokesman declined to comment on whether the Fed chairman will be meeting with the President or White House officials on Monday's stock market collapse.     The spokesman said the Fed chief was returning to Washington "to monitor events here."     Greenspan earlier today issued a statement that it will provide liquidity to support the economy and the financial system.     The Fed spokesman said the chairman wanted to reassure the market that the U.S. central bank is standing by in its role as a traditional liquidity provider.  Reuter &#3;
