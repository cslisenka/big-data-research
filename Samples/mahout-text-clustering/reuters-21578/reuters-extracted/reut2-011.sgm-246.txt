SWISSAIR TO BUY PRATT AND WHITNEY ENGINES

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> said it will buy Pratt and Whitney PW 4000 engines to power six newly-ordered McDonnell Douglas MD-11 long haul jets due to enter service from 1990.     The engine is a newly developed one which will enter operation in Summer 1987.     Swissair announced on March 19 that it was placing a firm order for six of the planes, with an option for another 12. It said at the time that it was not sure whether to equip them with General Electric, Rolls Royce or Pratt and Whitney engines.     Pratt and Whitney is a division of United Technologies Corp <UTX.N>.     A Swissair spokesman declined to say how much the engine order was worth. The total order, including six planes, engines and parts, is worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs.     If Swissair decides to exercise its option for the further 12 MD-11s these too would have Pratt and Whitney engines, the spokesman said.     He said the fact the airline's Boeing 747s, McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and Airbuses all have Pratt and Whitney engines played a major part in the decision.  REUTER &#3;
