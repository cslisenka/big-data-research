SENATOR SAYS REAGAN FARM REFORM PLANS DOOMED

Senator Kent Conrad, D-ND, said President Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the European Community, EC, will not accept it.     "It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystal clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies," said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.     Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with Brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan, export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps, said Conrad, a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Reuter &#3;
