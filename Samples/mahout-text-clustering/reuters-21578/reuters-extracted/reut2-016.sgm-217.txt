SHULTZ BEGINS TALKS WITH SHEVARDNADZE

U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met today an in elegant Moscow mansion in pursuit of the first superpower arms control agreement in nearly a decade.     Shultz, accompanied by senior advisers and technical experts, arrived from Helsinki aboard a U.S. Air Force plane and went straight into a closed-door meeting with Shevardnadze and Soviet negotiators.     State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters that U.S. Arms control advisers had been told not to discuss the U.S. Proposals with the press.     U.S. Officials have been optimistic about the possibility of progress at the talks, scheduled to end on Wednesday.     Shultz has been more guarded, saying that if the Soviet officials approached the talks in the same constructive spirit as the Americans "we should be able to move the ball along in a very positive way."     Shultz is expected to protest about a spying network that has come to light at the U.S. Embassy and which has cast a shadow over his talks. For its part the Soviet Union has said its diplomatic missions in the United States are subjected to surveillance and has accused Washington of "spy-mania."     Shevardnadze met Shultz with a handshake at the door of the ornate guest house built by a Russian merchant, now belonging to the Foreign Ministry. Later, in the white marble room where the discussions were being held, they had to be prompted by photographers to shake hands again.     "There was no instinctive warmth," an observer said.
