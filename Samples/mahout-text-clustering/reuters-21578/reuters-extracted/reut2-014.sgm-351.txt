WALL STREET STOCKS HIGHER AT MIDSESSION

Wall Street demonstrated its perseverance today as it recovered from an early wave of selling and posted a strong advance at midday. The gain was fueled by a strong auto sector as investors accumulated the stocks in anticipation of bullish news later this week.     The Dow Industrials, down 10 in the first minutes of the session when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscored the market's lingering interest rate anxieties, recovered to stand at 2417, up 11 points at midday. The broader market showed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead over declines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares.    Ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at 90-5/8, up 1/2. Traders said that speculation that the company will announce a stock split and dividend increase at its board meeting on Thursday, encouraged the buying. Ford rose 2-5/8 yesterday.     General Motors rose 1-5/8 to 83-1/8 in anticipation of bullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday, traders said. Chrysler, not expected to make any major announcements this week, fell 1/2 to 57-3/4.     "With the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have been holding the market up and that advance was sustained by an influx of foreign money," analyst Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said. "But poor breadth and poor performance by the transport and utility averages and the fact the market is at the top of its trading band supported in large part by foreign cash, makes this market vulnerable," he said.     Traders noted that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's remarks today concerning the dollar's performance and its bearing on monetary policy, injected caution into many investors.  Reuter &#3;
