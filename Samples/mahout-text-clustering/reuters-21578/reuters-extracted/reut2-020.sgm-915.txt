PERKIN-ELMER <PKN> PAPER AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed at A-1-plus commercial paper of Perkin-Elmer Corp.     S and P cited expectations of the firm to show sustained long-term profit improvement after a recent restructuring.     After two years of lackluster profitability and cuts in operations, activities concentrated in promising product lines and reduced the firm's overall cost base, S and P noted.     It added that cash flow should strengthen due to anticipated improvement in asset management. Balance sheet strength should continue with substantial liquidity and debt to total capital at 22 pct as of July 31, S and P said.  Reuter &#3;
