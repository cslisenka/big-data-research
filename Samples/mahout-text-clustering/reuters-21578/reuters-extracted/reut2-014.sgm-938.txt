IRAN MOUNTS FRESH ATTACKS ON IRAQ NEAR BASRA

Iranian forces mounted fresh attacks on the Gulf war southern front today but Iraq said all were repulsed with heavy loss of life.     The Iranian news agency IRNA said Iranian troops inflicted severe losses on Iraqi troops and military equipment on the second day of a new offensive east of Iraq's city of Basra.     "A number of tanks and personnel carriers were seized intact which were used against the enemy in the operational theatre," IRNA said.     The Iraqi news agency INA said Iraqi forces beat back the latest Iranian thrusts.     Baghdad said earlier that the Iranians had gained "footholds" on Iraqi territory after launching the offensive on three fronts near Basra.     IRNA said yesterday the Iranians overran the headquarters of two Iraqi brigades west of Fish Canal, a defensive line about 10 km from Basra.  Reuter &#3;
