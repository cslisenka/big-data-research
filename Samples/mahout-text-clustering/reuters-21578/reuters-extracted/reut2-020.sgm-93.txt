MINISTERS BACK EC FARM TRADE REFORM PLAN

European Community (EC) ministers backed a commission plan for the reform of world farm trade, which is due to be presented to GATT later this month, EC diplomats said.     The plan has been drawn up by the EC executive Commission in response to U.S. Calls in GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) for an end to all farm subsidies within the next 10 years. EC foreign ministers agreed that despite reservations by some member states, the plan should be presented to the next meeting of the GATT farm negotiating group in Geneva on October 26, diplomats said.
