He said the raid took place off the Iranian coast at 0600 gmt and all aircraft returned safely to base.     Lloyds Shipping Intelligence earlier today said the Greek bulk carrier Pamit, 84,137 tonnes dw, was attacked and hit in the engine room this morning in the northern Gulf.     It said all the crew were safe and tugs were heading to aid the ship.  Reuter &#3;
