CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES CLOSE MIXED

CBT soyproduct futures closed higher in sympathy with strength in new crop soybeans, with soymeal up 1.30 to 3.00 dlrs per ton and soyoil 0.19 to 0.15 cent per lb higher. May soymeal settled at 146.60 dlrs, with soyoil at 15.61 cents.     Steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis values this morning, plus trade talk of additional processor down-time in the U.S. over the next few weeks, added to the positive tone in meal futures, they said.     A local house bought over 600 contracts of July soymeal, with C and D Commodities, Dean Witter, E.F. Hutton and Merrill Lynch buying small amounts of nearbys, pit brokers said.     Commercials were the featured buyers in soyoil, with sellers scattered and small-lot.  Reuter &#3;
