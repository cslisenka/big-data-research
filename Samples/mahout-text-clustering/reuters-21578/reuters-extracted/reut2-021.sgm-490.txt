LUX FRANC BOND MARKET STALLED BY BELGIAN CRISIS

The thriving market in Luxembourg franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgian government crisis which has put the franc under pressure and forced up interest rates, banking sources said.     On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked him to try to form a new government.     Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA (BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL director Robert Sharfe said.     He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.     It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, banking sources said. However, no new placements are scheduled for another 10 days.     The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp (SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.     Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.     On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian franc came under pressure.     Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers, because they carry a relatively low interest rate.     Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong currency.  REUTER &#3;
