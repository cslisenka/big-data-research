TEXACO <TX> CONFIRMS TEXAS COURT FILING

Texaco Inc said it filed a petition in the Texas Court of Appeals for relief of the bond and lien provisions of the 10.3 billion dlr judgement in its legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.     Earlier today, a lawyer for Pennzoil told Reuters a filing had been made in the Texas court of Appeals.     "The petition asks the court to determine a reasonable security arrangement between Texaco and Pennzoil," Texaco said in a statement.     Texaco also said it asked the court for a temporary restraining order against Pennzoil's enforcement of the 10.3 billion dlr judgement until the petition is resolved.     According to Texas law, Texaco could be forced to post the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it fails to do so, Pennzoil could seek liens against Texaco's assets for the full amount of the judgement.     Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court stuck down a lower federal court ruling which had cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs. It said the issue should first be considered in Texas state Courts.     Earlier, the attorney for Pennzoil said Texaco had suggested a bond of one to 1.5 billion dlrs as a reasonable amount in today's filing.     But a Texaco spokesman had no immediate comment on the figure.       Reuter &#3;
