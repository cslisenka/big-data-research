CFTC STUDYING TRANSFERING SURVEILLANCE COSTS

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, and the White House budget office are exploring the possibility of transfering the three mln dlr annual cost of the commission's surveillance functions to the private sector, CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said.     Phillips told the House Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee that the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, had asked CFTC to study whether the market surveillance responsibilities could be paid for with user fees.     CFTC officials said the two agencies were studying whether commodity exchanges, futures commission merchants or market users should bear the cost of the surveillance program.     Phillips told Reuters that CFTC and OMB were expected to complete the study by mid-April.  Reuter &#3;
