WHITE HOUSE SLAPS TARIFFS ON JAPANESE GOODS

The White House announced 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese electronic goods, effective Friday.     The tariffs were imposed because of alleged Japanese failure to honor an agreement to stop below cost dumping of computer microchips on world markets and to open up its domestic markets to American goods.     "I regret that these actions were necessary," President Reagan said in a statement.     Reagan said the tariffs would be eliminated "as soon as we have firm and continuing evidence that the dumping in third country markets has stopped and that access to the Japanese market has improved."     He said he was encouraged by recent actions by Tokyo to improve compliance with the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement and he looked forward to the day when it was working as effectively as it should.
