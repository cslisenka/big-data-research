WET WEATHER SEEN NO PROBLEM YET FOR FRENCH FARMS

The wet, cold weather which has shrouded northern Europe recently is not a real problem for farmers yet, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm union, FNSEA, said.     The bad weather has only affected the northern part of France while the Mediterranean region needs more moisture.     Sugar beet producers said the climatic conditions are not causing them any difficulties yet although there could be problems if there is a lack of sun in the next few weeks.     The only real problem is for fruit producers in the north as people are consuming less fresh fruit and excessive rain rots the crop, she said.  Reuter &#3;
