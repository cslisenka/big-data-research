CHAIRMAN OF KING WORLD <KWP> FACES CHARGES

Roger King, chairman of King World Productions Inc, faces charges of cocaine possession, auto theft and strong-arm robbery stemming from his arrest in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last month, police said.     The report of King's legal problems sent the stock of his company -- a syndicator of some of television's most popular talk and game shows -- down sharply on Wall Street.     Fort Lauderdale police spokesman Ott Cefkin said King was arrested on February 21 on charges that he beat up a taxi driver during a dispute over a fare and then stole the man's car. After King was taken in custody, police found three small bags of cocaine in his shirt pocket, Cefkin said.     King World distributes Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and the Oprah Winfrey Show. According to the police report, King, 42, was in Fort Lauderdale visiting his brother when the incident occurred.     Police said a taxi driver picked King up outside a Fort Lauderdale night club but stopped the car after a short distance when he became concerned that his passenger would be unable to pay the fare.   "Mr. King attacked the driver, punched him and then took the cab and drove off," Cefkin said.   King was arrested by police a few minutes later and was charged with strong-arm robbery, auto theft and possession of a small quantity of cocaine, police said.  Reuter &#3;
