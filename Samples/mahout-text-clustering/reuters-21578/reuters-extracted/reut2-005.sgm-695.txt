UAW DENIES FORD <F> SET AS TARGET

The United Auto Workers denied a published report it is expected to pick Ford Motor Co to be the prime target in its upcoming contract talks with the auto industry.     A UAW spokesman called "premature" a press report that the union picked Ford over General Motors Corp <GM> as the lead company in talks expected to begin in mid to late July.     Earlier, the Detroit Free Press, quoting local union officials, said Ford would probably be picked as the auto company to set the pattern for a negotiated settlement with the entire U.S. car industry.     According to the report, the fact that Ford earned more money last year than GM will cause the union to select Ford as the company with which the union will negotiate the pattern-setting settlement.     The UAW traditionally picks one of the major car companies in its national contract talks with the auto industry, which occur every three years.     GM was named the lead company in the last round of talks in 1984.  Reuter &#3;
