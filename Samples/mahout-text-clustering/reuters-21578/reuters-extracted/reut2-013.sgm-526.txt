IRAQ SAYS IRAN OFFENSIVE ON SOUTHERN FRONT CHECKED

Iraq said today its troops had killed thousands of Iranians in checking a new Tehran offensive on their southern war front.     The official Iraqi news agency INA quoted a correspondent in the field as saying Baghdad's forces were pursuing retreating Iranian troops.     The agency said the al-Ghadeer Brigade of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the 21st Brigade had been destroyed in the fighting.     The INA correspondent said Iraqi troops had surrounded the Iranians after the overnight attack was launched.     The Iranian news agency IRNA said Iranian forces had killed or wounded over 2,600 Iraqis in their new Karbala-8 offensive and the thrust through Iraqi defences was continuing.     Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who presided over a meeting of his top military commanders in Baghdad two days ago, visited the northern city of Mosul today to attend celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party.     Reuter correspondent Subhy Haddad reported from Mosul that political observers there said Iran's offensive was timed to coincide with the party's anniversary. But radio programs were normal and there was no word in Mosul on fighting in the south.  REUTER &#3;
