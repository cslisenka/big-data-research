WHITE HOUSE BUDGET CHIEF CRITICIZES CHILES PLAN

White House Budget Director James Miller said a budget plan drafted by Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) was "seriously deficient."     In a statement, Miller called the senator's proposal for the government's fiscal 1988 budget would cut U.S. defense spending authority by more than 25 billion dlrs from President Reagan's request, resulting in a real reduction of military spending authority for the third year in a row.     While the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending to rise by 5.6 billion dlrs, domestic spending would be increased by a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs, he said.     Miller also criticized the Chiles plan's call for a 13.6 billion dlr tax increase.     "The president has said repeatedly that he would veto any tax increase," Miller said.  Reuter &#3;
