FRANCE PLANS TO COVER SOCIAL SECURITY DEFICIT

French government ministers will meet next Tuesday to discuss measures to cover the state Social Security Fund's deficit before the summer, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's social affairs adviser, Marie-Helene Berard, said.     Employment Ministry officials say the fund, in surplus until 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of this year, largely because of rising unemployment. Budget Minister Alain Juppe said the fund needed more resources and a management overhaul. The government was not in favour of introducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the  previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, he said.  REUTER &#3;
