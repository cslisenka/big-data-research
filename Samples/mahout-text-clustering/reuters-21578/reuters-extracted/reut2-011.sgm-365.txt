FIAT PLANS MORE INVOLVEMENT IN HIGH TECH SECTORS

Italian automotive group Fiat SpA <FIAT.MI> plans greater involvement in emerging high-technology sectors which it believes will represent an increasing share of advanced economies, a group executive said.     Francesco Gallo, senior vice-president of international activities, told a conference that Fiat was "fully aware that in the years to come, the automotive industry will not be among the fastest growing businesses."     The group, with estimated revenue last year of 29,020 billion lire, would develop further in space and defence, telecommunications, bioengineering, and aviation, he said.  Reuter &#3;
