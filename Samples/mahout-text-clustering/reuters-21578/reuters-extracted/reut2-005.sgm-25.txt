STORAGE TECH <STK> IN DISCUSSIONS WITH IRS

Storage Technology Corp said it is holding dicussions with the Internal Revenue Service that could end their dispute over the amount of back taxes owed by the company.     "We are currently pursuing discussions with the IRS that could lead to a final solution," Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief operating officer said. "Simultaneously, we are taking all necessary actions to try to expedite the court appeal process, resolve these issues and allow final court approval of the plan of reorganization, by our target date of June 30, 1987," he said.     Last year, Storage Technology's bankruptcy court ruled that the company owed about 25 mln dlrs in taxes, an amount much lower than the IRS is seeking.     The IRS has appealed the court's decision.     Jerritts also said his company and <Siemens AG> of West Germany extended an agreement under which Storage Technology distributes a laser printer made by Siemens.  Reuter &#3;
