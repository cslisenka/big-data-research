RAPITECH <RPSY.O> IN HEWLETT PACKARD <HWP> DEAL

Rapitech Systems Inc said it has entered into an agreement under which its FORTRIX-C software is available to Hewlett-Packard Co's salesforce for assisting customers the migration of applications software from one operating environment to another.     The company also said FORTRIX-C has been selected by American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> for use in its Vendor Involvement Program.  It said it cannot forecast the impact on its profits because neither agreement contains purchase requirements.     It said it expects continued losses through the rest of fiscal 1987 ending July 31.     The company lost 548,000 dlrs last year. Today it reported a nine month loss of 810,000 dlrs compared with a 394,000 dlr loss a year earlier and attributed the poorer performance to substantially increased marketing, sales and research expenditures partly resulting from the hiring of additional staff.     Rapitech further said it has signed agreements for Computer Systems and Consultants BV of the Netherlands and Sages Group of France to represent the Rapitech Conversionware product line in the Benelux countries, in France and in French-speaking cantons of Switzerland.
