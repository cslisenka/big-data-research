UK OFFICIAL SEES TRANSATLANTIC AIR TRAFFIC RISE

U.K. Minister for Aviation Michael Spicer said transatlantic traffic should increase at least five pct this year, after dropping nearly six pct last year.     "We expect at least a five pct increase and it may exceed that, reaching at least the peak levels of 1985," Spicer said at a press conference.     The figures refer to air traffic between North America and Europe.     Spicer also said transport ministers of the European Community meeting next week are expected to agree on liberalizing air traffic regulations in Europe.     Spicer said fears of terrorism dissuaded Americans from traveling to Europe last year, resulting in pent up demand that will be released this year.     He said the ministers, scheduled to meet in Brussels Monday and Tuesday, should agree on allowing more than one airline to fly particular routes between European cities, removing some fare restrictions and easing capacity restrictions.     Spicer also said he has asked U.S. officials to consider allowing investment in U.S. carriers, particularly in smaller commuter airlines, by foreign companies. He also wants U.S. officials to allow British carriers to fly more freely between U.S. destinations.  Reuter &#3;
