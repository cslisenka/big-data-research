FUJITSU SAYS SOME ISSUES RESOLVED IN IBM DISPUTE

Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> and International Business Machines Corp <IBM.N> (IBM) had resolved some issues in a longstanding dispute over software copyright protection, Fujitsu said in a prospectus for a warrant bond recently issued in London.     The dispute involved questions of contractual interpretation arising from a 1983 agreement between the companies, the prospectus said.     Under question was how much software information the firms were obliged to disclose to each other. The case had been before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) since 1985.     "By subsequent agreements, the parties have resolved some of the issues and have established procedures to resolve presently outstanding disputes with the involvement of the members of the panel of arbitrators," the prospectus said.     "The Company is not in a position to predict with certainty the outcome of this process and its effect on the future results or operations, financial or otherwise, of the Group," it said.     A Fujitsu spokeswoman declined to comment on the prospectus, noting the dispute remained under arbitration by the AAA. An IBM spokesman here also declined comment.     Last November the AAA ordered both companies to maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings and said that both Fujitsu and IBM had agreed that no additional comment on the subject be made.     Late last year, IBM and Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> said they had agreed to revise a separate 1983 agreement which arose out of software disputes similar to those between Fujitsu and IBM.  REUTER &#3;
