FAA SEES COMMERICAL AVIATION GROWTH CONTINUING

The Federal Aviation Administration said it expected continued growth for commercial aviation in the next 12 years, with passenger traffic increasing at an annual rate of 4.5 pct on major scheduled airlines and 6.7 pct on commuter airlines.     However, the FAA forecast projects slower growth for general aviation than for the air carriers.     The number of hours flown by private and business flyers, for example, is expected to grow at an annaul rate of less than one pct compared with a six pct rate in the 1960s and 1970s.  REUTER &#3;
