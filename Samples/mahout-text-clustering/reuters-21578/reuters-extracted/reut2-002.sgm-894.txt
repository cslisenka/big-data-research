GINNIE MAE DROPS FEE INCREASE ON SECURITIES

The Government National Mortgage Association has decided not to raise its guarantee fee on mortgage securities, Louis Gasper, Ginnie Mae executive vice president said.     Ginnie Mae, which guarantees securities backed by Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgages, had planned to raise the fee March one from six basis points to 10 basis points. Mortgage bankers strongly opposed the proposed fee increase.     Gasper said it became apparent Congress was ready to pass legislation that would have rescinded the fee increase.  Reuter &#3;
