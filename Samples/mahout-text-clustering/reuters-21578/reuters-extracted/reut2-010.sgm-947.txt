BANKS FILE SUIT AGAINST SAUDI COMPANY

Four international banks have filed claims for 131.2 mln riyals against the owners of Saudi construction and trading group Abdulla Fouad and Sons Co, bankers and lawyers in the Kingdom said.     Bankers said the suit may prove to be a test case for banks which have so far been largely frustrated in their attempts to reclaim loans through the Saudi Arabian legal system.     Citibank N.A., Bank of America NT and SA, Arab Banking Corp (ABC) and the Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait (BBK) filed claims with a special Saudi court under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce on March 7.
