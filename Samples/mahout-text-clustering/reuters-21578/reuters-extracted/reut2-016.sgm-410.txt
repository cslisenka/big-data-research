TEXSCAN TO FILE REORGANIZATION PLAN

<Texcan Corp> said it reached an agreement in principle with its major creditors on a reorganization plan to lift it out of bankruptcy.     The plan proposes Texcan to pay its bank debt partially through a 15 mln dlr secured obligation, to pay its general trade debt of two mln dlrs, and to satisfy subordinate debenture holders through issuance of 45 pct of the stock of the reorganized corporation, it said.     Texcan said its bank debt will be paid to United Bancorp of Arizona's <UBAZ> United Bank of Arizona and Security Pacific's Corp's <SPC> Security Pacific Bank.     Subordinated bondholders also will have the right to subscribe to buy an additional 40 pct of the common stock of the reorganized corporation for three mln dlrs under an arrangement to be announced in a few weeks, Texscan said.     Total debt claims have been filed in the Chapter 11 proceeding of 110 mln dlrs, it said.     Texscan said its existing stock will be extinguished under the proposed reorganization plan. The company said it filed for reorganization Nov 22, 1985.  Reuter &#3;
