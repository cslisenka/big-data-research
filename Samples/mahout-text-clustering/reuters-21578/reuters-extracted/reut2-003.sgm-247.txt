LONDON SEES NYSE RULE PROBLEM BEING SETTLED

London Stock Exchange officials feel confident that problems arising from a New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, rule which might limit the trading activities in London of NYSE members can be solved, a London Exchange spokeswoman said.     The situation will be sorted out during the regular contacts between the two exchanges, she added.     Recent press reports raised the possibility that an NYSE rule could bar its members from trading jointly listed stocks on the London Exchange during hours when the NYSE was open. London plans to close its trading floor in due course, but the NYSE only recognises foreign exchanges which possess a trading floor. &#3;
