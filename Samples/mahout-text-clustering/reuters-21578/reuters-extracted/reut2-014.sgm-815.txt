H.K. OFFICIAL, STOCK EXCHANGE BAR JARDINE ISSUE

Securities Commissioner Ray Astin and Chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ronald Li said in a joint statement they have rejected a plan by Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HK> to list its new "B" shares and that other such plans will not be approved.     They said the move resulted from recognition of the potential disadvantages of listing "B" shares and from strong opposition by stock brokers and members of the exchange.     They also noted both Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> and associate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK> have agreed to withdraw previously announced plans to issue "B" shares.     The Cheung Kong firms each announced bonus issues of one new "B" share for each two ordinary shares last week after a proposed four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares by Jardine.     The stock exchange then barred any further issues of "B" shares, except the three proposals already submitted. The "B" shares have equal voting rights with existing shares but a much lower par value.     The exchange's Hang Seng index lost 134 points between Jardine Matheson's March 27 announcement and its close at 2,664.70 yesterday. But the index rose over 40 points in early trading today and brokers linked the rise to the statement.  REUTER &#3;
