GROW GROUP <GRO> DELAYS SPINOFF OF SUBSIDIARY

Group Group Inc said it has delayed the distribution of the common shares of its Grow Ventures Corp subsidiary scheduled for today.     The company said the spinoff, which is subject to required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other conditions, has been delayed due to the commission's heavy workload, which has not permitted a review of Grow Group's filings.     As soon as these filings are processed by the SEC a new distribution date will be announced, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
