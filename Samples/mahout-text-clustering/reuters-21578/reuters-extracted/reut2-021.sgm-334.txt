SALOMON NOT PULLING OUT OF EUROYEN BONDS

<Salomon Brothers Inc> is not withdrawing as a market maker in euroyen bonds, contrary to strong market rumours circulating in London, a London-based spokeswoman for the company's New York headquarters said.     Earlier, a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' London operations declined to comment at all on rumours that have been circulating here.     Euroyen bond traders had said they were informally contacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that they would no longer be market makers in those securities.     The traders said that Salomon had not notified the Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plans to withdraw as a market maker. Under new rules recently adopted by the AIBD, notification would be required if the firm decided it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in euroyen bonds.     According to dealers at several Japanese banks, Salomon's euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to make prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered the traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.     Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bond issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated bonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as the currency of choice for international borrowers.     Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, the yen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables.     Last week, Salomon Brothers announced it would trim its worldwide staff by 800 and withdraw from several areas of business, most specifically short term bank lending.  REUTER &#3;
