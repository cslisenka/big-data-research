LONDON SUGAR OPENS SLIGHTLY EASIER

Raw sugar futures continued their overnight decline in early trading by posting losses from yesterday's final call of 0.40 to 1.20 dlrs, dealers said.     Volume at the end of a 10 minute opening call was 85 lots.     The modest fall was attributed to lack of follow-through to yesterday's mid-session rise with New York's similar downturn yesterday seen as an additional unsettling influence, they said.     There is no fresh physicals news although India and Syria are in the market tomorrow for whites, to coincide with the weekly white sugar tender by the European Community (EC).     Near Aug was at 155.40 dlrs traded from 155.80 bid.  REUTER &#3;
