FRESH DEBATE ON NORWAY'S EC MEMBERSHIP WELCOMED

European Community officials welcomed Norway's recent move to renew a public debate on Community membership but said Norway should not expect special trade advantages as long as it stays outside the EC.     Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on external affairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week with Norway's minority Labour government had helped clarify several misconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of EC membership in a 1972 referendum.     "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outside the club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not out of it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adapt its EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch an internal trade market from 1992.     The government, worried that the internal market will hamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds of Norway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament asking political parties and the public to reassess the country's relationship to the EC.
