IRAN REPORTS OFFENSIVE AS IRAQ THREATENS AIR RAIDS

Iranian troops are fighting on two widely separated fronts in a new offensive in the mountains of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, Tehran's IRNA news agency said.     Baghdad war communiques made no mention of fresh fighting on northern or southern sectors, but a military spokesman threatened a resumption of air raids on Iranian towns.     IRNA, monitored by the BBC in London, said Iran had seized several strategic heights in the northern assault, which started on Tuesday. It said at least 2,000 Iraqi troops had been killed, wounded or captured. The offensive is in the Haj Omran area of Kurdistan, scene of fierce fighting in 1983.     Tehran radio reported last night that Iranian forces were in control of four mountain areas, bringing several Iraqi towns with troop concentrations within artillery range.     In the south, IRNA said, Iranian forces captured several Iraqi defence posts east of Iraq's second city, Basra, in a drive north along the Shatt al-Arab waterway.     Today is the end of a two-week-long Iraqi moratorium on air raids declared on condition that Iran stop attacking Iraqi territory and shelling its towns.     Iraq's war spokesman said Iran had kept up its attacks and had made "boasts of illusory victories."  REUTER &#3;
