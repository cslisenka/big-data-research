NAKASONE DEFENDS SALES TAX AS CAMPAIGNING BEGINS

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended his tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within his own party, as campaigning for local elections began.     "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to decay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).     The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.     Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in the tax reform package, and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.     In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands.     A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next January, into consideration when they vote.     Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)."     The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures.     A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified, said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party affiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.
