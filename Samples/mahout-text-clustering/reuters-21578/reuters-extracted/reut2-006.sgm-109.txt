BAYER CONFIRMS IT RECEIVED AIDS DAMAGE CLAIMS

West German chemical group Bayer AG <BAYG.F> said it had received claims for damages from haemophilics who allege they were infected with AIDS through a blood plasma produced by a Bayer subsidiary.     Bayer's shares fell 13 marks to close at 292 in Frankfurt today. Dealers said a newspaper report about possible huge claims for damages triggered off the share selling in Bayer, other pharmaceuticals and insurance companies.     Bayer said in a statement it was insured against claims and had received two. Bayer did not rule out that some infections may have been passed on through the plasma in the past.     But the company added that the method of production had been changed and according to current knowledge there was now no danger of contracting AIDS through the blood plasma. The plasma is used by haemophilics to aid the clotting of blood.     The Hamburg-based news magazine "Der Spiegel" reported in its latest edition that the West German pharmaceutical industry could face billions of marks worth of claims for damages from infected haemophilics and their relatives.
