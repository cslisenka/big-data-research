DANISH RESERVES RISE IN MARCH

Denmark's net official reserves rose to 49.49 billion crowns in March from 36.34 billion in February, against 43.13 billion in March 1986, the central bank said in its monthly balance sheet report.     Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate adjustments, rose to 45.263 billion crowns from 37.26 billion in February, compared with 35.31 billion in March 1986.     "The increase must be seen against the background of a considerable inflow of foreign exchange after the outflow up to the EMS realignment in January," the bank said in a statement.  REUTER &#3;
