THL HOLDINGS PLANS TO REDEEM UNIT'S PREFERRED

<THL Holdings Inc> said a purpose of its planned common stock offering would be to redeem its Series B preferred stock of its subsidiary, SCOA Industries Inc <SCOA>.     THL said if the public offering is successful, it plans to redeem the preferred stock at 25 dlrs per share, plus accrued dividends.     The company said it planned to use the proceeds from the public offering to finance the redemption of the preferred stock.     It said the company plans to seek approval of the holders of the Series B preferred stock to redeem the Series B shares without at the same time redeeming another series of SCOA's preferred stock.     The company said if the approval is not obtained, SCOA has the right to redeem both series simultaneously.     THL said it announced on February 25, 1987, its intention to make a public offering of common stock.  Reuter &#3;
