THIRD MARINE ARRESTED; U.S. PRESSES SPY PROBE

A second U.S. Marine has been charged with spying and a third arrested on suspicion of lying about contacts with Soviet women in a growing scandal involving the American Embassy in Moscow.     The Pentagon made the announcements yesterday and the State Department said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Brown had been called home to supervise a security review of the embassy, which is alleged to have been penetrated by Soviet KGB agents helped by Marine guards.     Brown is an ex-Marine who once was an economic officer at the Moscow mission.     Marine Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, was charged yesterday with espionage, conspiracy and failure to follow lawful orders in a case which U.S. officials have said involved sex with Soviet women. Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, whose arrest triggered the spy-sex scandal, has already been charged with espionage.     Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims told reporters a third Marine, Staff Sgt. Robert Stanley Stufflebeam, 24, who served in Moscow between 1985 and 1986 at the same time as Lonetree and Bracy, was being held on suspicion of lying to investigators about contacts with foreign nationals.     Stufflebeam, who was second in command of the embassy guard, is suspected of failure to report all contacts with foreigners and making false official statements in his debriefing when he left the embassy.
