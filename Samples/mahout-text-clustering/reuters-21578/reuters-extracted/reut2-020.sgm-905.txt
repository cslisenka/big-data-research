AMCA INTERNATIONAL <AIL> SEES 4TH QTR PROFIT

AMCA International said it expects to earn a profit in the fourth quarter which will exceed the third quarter result.     The company earned 4.9 mln dlrs in the third quarter against a year earlier loss of 56.2 mln. However, after the payment of preferred dividends it lost two cents per share from a loss of 1.79 dlrs per share last year.     In the 1986 fourth quarter, the company had an operating loss of 4.9 mln dlrs, or 98 cents per share. It said its positive outlook was based on expected debt bill reduction and an improved backlog of orders.     The company also said its board approved a decision to sell its Manitoba Rolling Mills. It did not elaborate.  Reuter &#3;
