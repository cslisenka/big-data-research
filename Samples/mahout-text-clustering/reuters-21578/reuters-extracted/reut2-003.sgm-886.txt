WHITE HOUSE OPPOSES STOCK TRANSFER TAX

The White House said that a proposal by House Speaker Jim Wright for a tax on stock transfers "would clearly be a tax increase" and that President Reagan opposed it.     Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noted that some 47 mln Americans owned securities, shares in mutual funds or had pensions invested in the stock market.     He said Wright's proposal differed from user fees, which the Administration has proposed in its budget and "clearly is a tax increase."  Reuter &#3;
