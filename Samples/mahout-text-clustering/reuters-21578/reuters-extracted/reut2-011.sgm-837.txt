BAHRAIN COMMERCIAL BANKS INTRODUCE FIVE-DAY WEEK

Bahrain is the first Gulf Arab country to introduce an obligatory five-day working week for its commercial banks ending a traditional six-day week.     The Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) said the regulation applied only to the domestic sector comprising about 20 commercial banks and was not obligatory for the island's approximately 70  offshore banks.     BMA Banking Services Director, Sulman Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, said commercial banks will now open from Sunday to Thursday and added that twenty-one offshore banking units had also requested and been given permission for a five-day week.
