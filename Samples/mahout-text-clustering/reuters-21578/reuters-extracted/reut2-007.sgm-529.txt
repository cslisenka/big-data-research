BELGRADE UNIONS ATTACK YUGOSLAV PAY FREEZE

Belgrade trade union leaders have joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia and reported strikes spreading to the capital.     Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions council, said the government must take responsibility for the effects of the law imposing the wage freeze.     Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and will remain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarter of 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged to productivity. The move has caused resentment and widespread industrial unrest throughout the country.     Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on strike in Belgrade.     Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communist political system and their role has traditionally not been to defend workers from the government. The criticisms by the Belgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentment of the law than earlier reported.     The government has officially reported 70 strikes throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have indicated there have been more.  REUTER &#3;
