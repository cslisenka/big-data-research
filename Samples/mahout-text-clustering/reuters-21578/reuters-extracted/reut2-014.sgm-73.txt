CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES HIGHER IN EARLY TRADE

CBT soyproduct futures traded higher early in sympathy with the unexpected strength in soybeans, with soyoil up 0.13 to 0.16 cent per lb and soymeal 0.40 to 1.00 dlr per ton higher, traders said.     A mostly steady tone in overseas vegetable oils and feeds markets underpinned initial values here, they added.     A local professional house seen buying July soybeans also bought July soyoil, with Produce Grain a buyer of September, pit brokers said. Continental Grain and E.F. Hutton bought July soymeal, with sellers scattered and small-lot, they said.  Reuter &#3;
