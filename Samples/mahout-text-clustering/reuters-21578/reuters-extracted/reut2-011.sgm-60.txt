Non-U.S. citizens held 12.4 mln acres of privately owned U.S. agricultural land as of December 31, slightly less than one pct of the total agricultural land, but 369,000 acres above the foreign ownership at the end of 1985, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said forest land accounted for 52 pct of all foreign-owned acreage, cropland 17 pct, pastures and other agricultural land 26 pct and non-agricultural and unreported uses, five pct.     Corporations owned 79 pct of the foreign-held acreage, parternships 11 pct, and individuals eight pct, the department said. The remaining two pct was held by estates, trusts, associations, institutions and others, it said.  Reuter &#3;
