CHINA OMITS KEY REFORM FROM PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA

Hardliners have blocked debate on a key economic reform in China's parliament, a clear challenge to reformers among the leadership, western diplomats said.     The annual session of the National People's Congress next week was to have discussed a draft law which would bolster the independence of factory chiefs while eroding the power of local Communist Party officials.     The decision not to include the draft law was announced by the congress's standing committee, the People's Daily said. The committee's chairman is Peng Zhen, considered one of the more conservative figures in the Chinese leadership.     The "factory director responsibility system" covered by the draft law has already been experimentally introduced in state firms over the last three years, giving managers greater freedom from the control of factory party committees.     Diplomats said the agenda decision appeared to contradict assurances by top leader Deng Xiaoping that reforms were not threatened by the current campaign against "bourgeois liberalisation," or western political ideas.     Earlier this week Deng raised expectations for the session by saying plans to reform China's political structure would be unveiled in 1987, diplomats said.  REUTER &#3;
