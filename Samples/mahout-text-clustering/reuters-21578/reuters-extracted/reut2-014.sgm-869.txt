MALAYSIA SHELVES HUGE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT

Malaysia has decided to postone development of a five billion dlr hydroelectric power project in Sarawak, East Malaysia, until the economy improves, deputy Minister of Energy, Telecoms and Post Zainal Abidin Zin said.     He told reporters a shortage of funds forced the government to shelve the project, which involved building several dams and a 20,000 megawatt capacity undersea cable.     Malaysia originally planned to export electricity generated by the project to Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia by 2000 if the project could be started before 1996, Zainal said.  REUTER &#3;
