DOE MAKES ACID RAIN CLEANUP SOLICITATION

The Department of Energy said it is soliciting companies for innovative clean coal technologies as part of President Reagan's acid rain initiative.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said the 850 mln dlr solicitation is tailored to attract industry proposals for advanced pollution control devices that can be installed on existing coal-fired power plants.     Companies submitting the new technologies would need to at least match the federal funding share if their concept is selected, the DOE said. Herrington said he will appoint a senior panel to advise on the technologies.  Reuter &#3;
