NISSAN <NSAN.T>, LANCER IN FORKLIFT AGREEMENT

Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it and <Lancer Boss Group Ltd> of the U.K. Have agreed to cooperate on the design and manufacture of forklift trucks.     Under the accord, Lancer will start making jointly designed trucks at its plant in Moosburg, West Germany, from July with production reaching 300 three-wheeled and 100 four-wheeled trucks by end-March 1988. Output will be doubled from April 1, 1988, a Nissan spokeswoman said.     Nissan will start selling the three-wheelers under its brand-name later this year and the four-wheelers from the end of 1987, the company said.     The equipment manufacturing agreement with Lancer is a precaution against the European Community's (EC) January 1987 restriction on forklift truck exports to the EC, industry sources said.     Nissan exports 70 pct of its annual output of 16,000 forklift trucks, shipping 2,548 units to the EC in 1986, the spokeswoman said.  REUTER &#3;
