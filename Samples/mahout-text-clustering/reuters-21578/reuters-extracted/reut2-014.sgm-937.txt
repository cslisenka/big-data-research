CALIFORNIA MOVES AGAINST KMG MAIN HURDMAN

California regulators said they were seeking disciplinary action against the accounting firm KMG Main Hurdman as the result of a 1985 audit of Technical Equities Corp., an investment firm that filed for bankruptcy last year.     A spokeswoman for the California Board of Accountancy, which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, said a six-page complaint was filed against the New York-based accounting firm.     "We basically charged that the Technical Equities audit was not conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards," Della Bousquet, executive officer for the board, told Reuters in a telephone interview.     She said a hearing would probably be held before an administrative law judge within three months. Penalties could range from censure to revocation of KMG Main Hurdman's license to do business in California.     KMG Main Hurdman merged last week with Peat Marwick Mitchell of New York to become the world's largest accounting firm.     The San Francisco office of the firm declined to comment on the board's allegations.     Bousquet said the company, among other things, was accused of not properly investigating financial transactions and of issuing a favorable opinion in August 1985 that relied on misrepresentations of Technical Equities management.     She said the accounting firm, although it knew Technical Equities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, was accused of not performing a proper audit of it.     The complaint named four individuals, including two partners and two audit managers.     Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986, listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.     Many of the investors were prominent sports and broadcasting figures.  Reuter &#3;
