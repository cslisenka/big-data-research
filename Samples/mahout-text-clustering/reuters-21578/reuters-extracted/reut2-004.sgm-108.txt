JAPAN READY TO DISCUSS BANK REGULATION

Japan is ready to discuss bank regulation and capital adequacy with western monetary authorities but cannot say when or how joint rules can be agreed, Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairs Toyoo Gyohten said.     He told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets that Japan viewed a January outline agreement between the Bank of England and U.S. Regulatory authorities as "significant."     The accord, setting joint rules on capital adequacy, was criticised in financial markets for excluding Japan, thus putting U.S. And U.K. Banks at a disadvantage to Japanese banks     "I am pleased to say that we are prepared to work with British and American regulators," Gyohten said.     He added that preliminary contacts had already been made in the margin of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basle where central bank governors of western nations meet every month.     But proper negotiations were still some way off. "We have to start learning about the different situations in each country before we can start working towards joint rules," he said.     "I can't predict when or how we will reach conclusions," he added.  REUTER &#3;
