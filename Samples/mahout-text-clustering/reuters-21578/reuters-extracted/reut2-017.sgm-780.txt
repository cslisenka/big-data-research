ANHEUSER-BUSCH <BUD> UNIT CHANGES PLANT SITE

Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc said its Metal Container Corp subsidiary will build its planned beverage can manufacturing plant in Orange County, New York instead of Chester, New York.     The site was changed because Metal Container was unable to obtain necessary building permits within its construction schedule requirements, it said.     The proposed plant, which is expected to be completed in late 1988, will produce aluminum spin-neck cans and have an operating capacity of more than two billion cans a year, it said.  Reuter &#3;
