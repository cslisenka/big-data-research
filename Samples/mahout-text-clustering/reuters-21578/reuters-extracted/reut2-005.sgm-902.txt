GENETICS INSTITUTE <GENI> BUYS PLANT

Genetics Institute Inc said it has purchased a 139,000 square foot plant on 50 acres in Andover, Mass., to which it will move all of its process development and pilot and clinical production groups from its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, from Henley Group Inc <HENG> for 15.3 mln dlrs.     Genetics said the purchase of the plant will allow a fourfold expansion of its pilot and clinical production facilities for biotechnology-based human pharmaceuticals.     The company said it plans to invest another 20 mln dlrs to equip the facility for process development activities and clinical scale production.  Construction is to be completed by late 1987.
