FUNARO SHRUGS OFF CALLS FOR RESIGNATION

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro shrugged off demands by a group of Brazilian governors that he resign.     "At this moment I am discussing something much more serious for Brazil and it's absolutely indispensible in a negotiation like this one that I dedicate myself entirely to the discussions," Funaro told reporters.     Funaro, who spoke today to the International Monetary Fund's interim committee, was referring to talks he began Tuesday with creditor banks in New York in which unveiled Brazil's economic targets and financial needs.     The governor of Sao Paulo state Orestes Quersia and other governors last night called on Brazilian President Jose Sarney to assume direct control of the debt negotiations.     Asked if the governors' demands for his resignation would affect negotiations, Funaro said: "We are building a new refinancing position and that is what we are doing now. The rest is secondary."     He added that Brazil's economic program clearly demonstrates the intention to renegotiate the countries international financial committments, and added: "The domestic problems are our business."     Funaro said discussions on Brazil's refinancing proposals were well under way with private creditor banks and added World Bank President Barber Conable had also accepted the proposals as "a good plan" at a meeting they had last night.     But Conable, who was also present at today's IMF interim committee meeting told reporters that the World Bank wanted further clarifications on Brazil's economic programs.     "We wish further clarification about the program with respect to adjustment lending," Conable said.     He added that a World Bank mission would travel to Brazil early next week to explore the state of Brazil's new economic measures.  Reuter &#3;
