ZENITH <ZE> SEEKS HIGH COURT REVIEW ON DUMPING

Zenith Electronics Corp asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider its anti-dumping case against Japanese television manufacturers.     In a complex case that dates to 1974, Zenith has charged a group of Japanese companies with violations of U.S. antitrust and anti-dumping laws.     The U.S. electronics company today said it asked the high court to review a 1986 lower court ruling that dismissed both the antitrust and anti-dumping portions of the case.  Reuter &#3;
