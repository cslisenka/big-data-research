AUSTRALIAN STOCKS CLOSE AT RECORD, BUT OFF HIGHS

Australian share prices closed at record levels, boosted by continued demand for gold and blue chip industrials, but fell from the day's highs on late profit-taking, brokers said.     Hectic overnight demand for leading mining stocks by U.S. And European institutions spilled over into early trading here, boosting prices to new highs. Investors, encouraged by the record gain on Wall Street, a stronger local currency and easier interest rates, snapped up leading industrials.     But brokers said the late burst of profit-taking may signal the end of the bull run.     "But overseas people may disregard it tonight and see it as a small buying opportunity," one broker said. By the close of trading, the all ordinaries index had passed yesterday's record close by 7.4 points to reach 1753.7, but was well off its all time high of 1762.3.     The all industrials index had gained 13.3 points to 2614.7 and the all resources 3.0 points to 1097.9. The gold index had risen 44.7 to 3073.9, eclipsing yesterday's record close 3026.9.
