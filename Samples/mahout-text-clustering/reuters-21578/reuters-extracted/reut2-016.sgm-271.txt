ALCIDE <ALCD.O> SAYS TESTS ENCOURAGING

Alcide Corp said preliminary experimental results obtained using a formulation it has developed for the disinfection of blood platelets indicate feasibility for the approach.     The company notes there have been recent increases in reports of transmission of microbial infections in recipients of platelets, which are used in blood transfusions in patients undergoing cancer therapy.     The company said related whole blood tests with baboon blood showed no significant loss of in vitro activities or survival.     The company said as a followup to the studies on thje bacterial disinfection of platelets, it is planning to evaluate the system for the inactivation of several viruses in the presence of platelets.  The viruses include Herpes Simplex Virus Type I, cytomegalovirus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which is responsible for AIDS.  Reuter &#3;
