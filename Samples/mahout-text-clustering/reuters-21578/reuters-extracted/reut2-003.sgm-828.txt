WRIGHT SAYS HOUSE WILL VOTE TO BLOCK CONTRA AID

House Speaker Jim Wright predicted the House would vote by a substantial margin to block 40 mln dlrs in aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels until President Reagan has accounted for previous assistance.     Wright, a Texas Democrat, conceded Congress ultimately will be unable to stop the money but said the House vote expected later today will tell the White House its contra program -- one of Reagan's pet projects -- is in trouble.     "The adminstration must face reality and focus on other ways to find peace," Wright said.     The House is voting on legislation that would block for six months 40 mln dlrs appropriated last year. The administration has said it intends to start using the money next month to provide arms and equipment to the rebels.     "We expect to win by a substantial margin," Wright said.     The legislation calls on Reagan to account for all previous aid, including money diverted to the contras from the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran. The scandal over the arms sales and the diversion of profits to the contras has plunged the Reagan administration into its deepest crisis.     The legislation also demands an accounting of 27 mln dlr in humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress in 1985 and all funds given to the contras by foreign governments or private individuals at the urging of the Reagan administration.
