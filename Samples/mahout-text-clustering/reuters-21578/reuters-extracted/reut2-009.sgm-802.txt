NEW CAPITAL RULES WOULD FAVOR FIRST INTERSTATE

First Interstate Bancorp <I> would benefit from new banking capital adequacy rules proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, Chairman Joseph Pinola said.     "We are one of the few banks that would have an improved position," Pinola said in an interview, noting First Interstate has fewer off balance sheet liabilities than many other banks.     Under the proposed rules, a bank's minimum capital requirement would be determined by the assessed risk of their assets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are not currently taken into account.     Currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5 pct.     First Interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14 pct at the end of 1986.     Pinola said First Interstate has since raised that ratio, however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stock offering and a 200-mln-dlr subordinated capital note offering announced yesterday.     First Interstate reported a relatively average return on assets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.     Pinola said First Interstate's return on assets ratio will improve to the 0.70-0.71 range at the end of the first quarter, because 1986 year-end assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, were overestimated by about two billion dlrs.     He said he is anxious to improve the return on assets ratio further, but continued loan losses at First Interstate's Rocky Mountain state banks continue to hold down profits.     Pinola said its banks in other states are showing excellent return on asset ratios, with its Arizona and Washington banks running at about 1.30, its Oregon bank showing 1.00 and its California bank at about 0.83.
