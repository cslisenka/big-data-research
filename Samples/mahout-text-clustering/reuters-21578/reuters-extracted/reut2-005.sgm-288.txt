17 KILLED AFTER SOVIET DAM COLLAPSES

Seventeen people were killed and 22 are missing after a dam collapsed following heavy rains in Soviet Tadzhikistan, the official news agency Tass said.     Water broke through the dam in the Kulyab region of the Central Asian republic, and fell on the village of Sargazan, sweeping away 53 houses, destroying bridges and damaging railway lines, Tass said.     The Central Committee of the Tadzkhikistan Communist Party had sent condolences to the relatives of the dead, Tass said.  Reuter &#3;
