BELL ATLANTIC <BEL> UNIT HAS MARKETING APPROVAL

New Jersey Bell, wholly owned by Bell Atlantic Corp, said the Federal Communications Commission will allow it to market its network service with equipment provided by Bell Atlanticom Systems, an unregulated company also wholly owned by Bell Atlantic.     New Jersey Bell said the FCC ruling gives it interim relief from current accounting restrictions until the company's plans for complying with new accounting rules are approved by the FCC.     New Jersey Bell said the FCC ordered January one that telephone companies could offer equipment as long as they complied with new accounting rules that separate costs of regulated service from unregulated activities.     New Jersey Bell said the joint marketing program between it and Bell Atlanticom Systems will apply initially to New Jersey Bell's largest business customers.  Reuter &#3;
