MISSED SENATE DEADLINE UPSETS U.S. BUDGET CHIEF

White House Budget Chief James Miller said he was irritated by the Senate Budget Committee's failure to meet an April 1 deadline for completing action on its budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year.     "I'm terribly upset that they've missed their deadline," he told reporters after a speech commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).     Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) "is obviously having trouble getting a majority (of his committee) to agree to his budget," Miller said. The panel late Wednesday defeated Chiles' budget plan and will try again next week.     The House Budget Committee, meanwhile, approved Wednesday a trillion-dlr spending plan for the government's year beginning Oct. 1, paving the way for a House vote.     Miller also told reporters President Regan remains opposed to any tax increases other than those he himself has proposed. "We're not going to go along with a tax increase," he said.     Miller told a few hundred current and former ICC officials attending the birthday party that he was an unusual choice to speak at the event as he favored the agency's abolition.     "Let it die with dignity--and then we'll all get together again for a fantastic wake," he said to mild applause.  Reuter &#3;
