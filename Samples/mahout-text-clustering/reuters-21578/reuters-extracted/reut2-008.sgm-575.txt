MULRONEY CALLS ON CONGRESS FOR ACID RAIN ACTION

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called on Americans to pressure Congress in the fight against acid rain in what some observers said may represent a shift in Canada's lobbying strategy with the United States.     Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlife conference that he has not been pleased with the U.S. administration's lack of speed in acting on the question, which Canada sees, he said, "as a test of our relationship" with the U.S.     Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report by specially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week, the White  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fund the acid rain fight.     Mulroney described the commitment as "significant," but noted it was a long time in coming.     "We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go," Mulroney said. "But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace with which the U.S. administration moved to implement the president's acceptance of the envoy report."     The prime minister urged his mostly American audience to help Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his government is determined to fight on more than one front.     "The campaign does not involve either or choices between the administration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other," he said.     The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's call to take the battle to Congress.     "It is clear that he has an understanding now that Congress must be emphasized as equally as the administration," said spokesman Michael Perley.      Reuter &#3;
