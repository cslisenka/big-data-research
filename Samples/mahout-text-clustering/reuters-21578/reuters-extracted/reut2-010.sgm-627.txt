CHINA HELPS IRAN TO DEVELOP NEW MISSILES - PAPER

Iran has produced a short-range surface-to-surface missile with technological help from China and is working with Peking on a longer-range missile capable of hitting most areas of Iraq, the Observer newspaper said.     The British Sunday paper, quoting Iranian sources, said the shorter-range missile was based on a Chinese version of the Soviet-made Frog and had been fired at the Iraqi port of Basra. The missile has a range of 40 miles.     The other type, similar to the Soviet army"s Scud B with a range of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development, according to the Observer.     The development of a longer-range weapon would enable Iran to strike at many towns and cities on the territory of its relatively small neighbour.     Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged it had acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankers carrying crude oil from Arab countries to the West.     Iran said it would use its Silkworm anti-ship missile against shipping in the waterway only if Iraqi air and missile raids prevented it from exporting oil.     The Silkworms are large mobile missiles with a range of 60 miles, which can carry a warhead of 1,000 pounds.  REUTER &#3;
