BMC INDUSTRIES <BMC> UNIT GETS SOVIET CONTRACT

BMC Industries Inc said its West German subsidiary has received a contract valued at about eight mln dlrs from the Soviet Union to supply engineering and manufacturing services to build a television parts plant.     The company's Precision Etched Products unit in Muellheim, West Germany, signed the contract to provide services that will enable the Soviets to build a plant to make television tube aperture masks, it said.     A BMC spokesman told Reuters the one-year contract will be for about eight mln dlrs. The contract is the first BMC has had with the Soviet Union in 10 years ago, he said.     The project has received the necessary U.S. government clearances, he said.     BMC also said it has entered into a joint venture agreement with Italy to produce finished single vision plastic eyewear lenses using a new manufacturing process. It would provide no further details.  Reuter &#3;
