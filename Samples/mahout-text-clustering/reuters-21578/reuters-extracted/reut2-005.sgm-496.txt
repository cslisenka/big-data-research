WORLDGROUP <TOURA> SUED BY TRAVEL AGENCIES

Worldgroup Cos Inc said it was sued by two companies operating three franchised travel agencies for violating franchise and trademark agreements.     The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the western district of Missouri, seeks 385,000 dlrs for losses and almost 9.2 mln dlrs in additional damages.     The suit alleges the sale of the franchises by IT Financial Corp of Tulsa to International Tours Inc, a Worldgroup unit, violated franchise, trademark and other agreements. It also claims the defendants have conspired to restrain trade and violated federal racketeering laws, the company said.     Worldgroup said the claims are unfounded and that it plans to defend itself vigorously.     In addition to Worldgroup and IT Financial, K mart Corp <KM> was named as a defendant, Worldgroup said. Worldgroup has agreements with K mart to market travel services.  Reuter &#3;
