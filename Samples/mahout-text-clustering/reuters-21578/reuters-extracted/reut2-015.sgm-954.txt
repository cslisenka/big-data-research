KIDDER, PEABODY DEFENDS EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTING

Kidder, Peabody and Co vice president Edward Weihenmayer said his company was giving drug tests to all employees to make sure its funds and assets were being handled properly.     "Drugs are easily available in the Wall Street area," Weihenmayer told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We move billions of dollars around in tens of thousands of transactions daily and have a legitimate interest in the safety and security of those assets."     He said customers had a right to expect that their funds were being handled by sober and drug-free professionals.     Weihenmayer said almost all Wall Street firms were testing new employees and many were testing all workers.     He said Kidder, Peabody would try to help anyone found to be using drugs, but those who failed a second test would almost certainly be fired.    "Our objective is to strive for a drug-free enviroment," he said.     Committee chairman Joseph Biden said drug tests posed a difficult problem in balancing the rights of workers with the need for companies to eliminate drugs from the work-place.     "There is no easy answer," the Delaware Democrat said.  Reuter &#3;
