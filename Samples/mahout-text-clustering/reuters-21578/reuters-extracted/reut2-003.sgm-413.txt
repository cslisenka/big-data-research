N.Z. FOREIGN DEBT FALLS TO 32.94 BILLION DLRS

New Zealand's total foreign debt fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the quarter end December 31 against 33.42 billion in the quarter end September 30, revised from 33.12 billion dlrs, and 24.61 billion in the quarter end March 1985, the statistics department said.     The department began releasing quarterly figures in June 1986.     It said in a statement Government Corporation foreign debt in the December quarter fell to 5.86 billion against a 6.78 billion in the September quarter, revised from 6.63 billion and 5.25 billion in March quarter 1985.     Private sector foreign debt fell to 5.75 billion dlrs from 5.89 billion, revised from 5.74 billion, and 5.45 billion in March 1985.     Government departments and Reserve Bank foreign debt rose to 21.32 billion against 20.75 billion and 13.92 billion.     Contributing to the total fall of 0.48 billion dlrs were 2.11 billion in net realised and unrealised exchange gains, a result of an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar against other currencies, the department said.     The U.S. Dollar remained the predominant borrowing currency for all three sectors in the economy at December 31.  Reuter &#3;
