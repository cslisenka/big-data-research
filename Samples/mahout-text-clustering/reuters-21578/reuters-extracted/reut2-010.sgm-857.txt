BAXTER <BAX> STARTS CLINICAL TRIALS ON DRUG

Baxter Travenol Laboratories said its Hyland Therapeutics unit has started the first human clinical trials on genetically engineered Factor VIII, the clotting agent missing from the blood of most hemophiliacs.     It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use, genetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by the availability of human plasma and will be completely free from blood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis, Baxter said.     Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinical trials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived from human plasma that is produced using an advanced process incorporating monoclonal antibody purification.     It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnology company in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply the protein used for human clinical testing, as well as a substantial portion of ongoing production requirements.
