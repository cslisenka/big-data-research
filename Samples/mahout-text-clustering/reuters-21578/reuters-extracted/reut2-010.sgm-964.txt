YELLOW FREIGHT <YELL> FILES FOR RATE INCREASE

Yellow Freight System Inc said it filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a rate increase of 2.9 pct in Rocky Mountain territory,     It said the increase would offset labor and other cost increases and not make a contribution to operating margins.     The company said it took the independent action of filing for the rate increase following suspension by the commission of a general rate increase published by the Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau. It noted that at the same time the commission allowed similar increases published by the other regional rate bureaus.  Reuter &#3;
