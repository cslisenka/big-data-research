PORK BELLY FUTURES CLOSE MIXED

Pork belly futures traded on both sides of previous levels in choppy action before closing 0.62 cent lower to 0.70 higher. July paced nearbys lower while March led next year contracts higher. May ended at 66.17, off 0.22 cent.     Uneven price moves persisted as locals traded on both sides of the market. Local and wire house buying lifted prices early before locals turned sellers and touched off stop loss orders, traders said.     Expectations by some traders that this afternoon's out of town storage report would be negative to futures offset early support generated by higher live hog markets and light hog runs, they said.
