Royal Bank of Canada <RT.TO>  said it is extending its discount brokerage service which has been available to Ontario residents since last year, to Quebec investors.     The bank said the success of the Ontario service is also prompting it to consider making the service available in several other provinces.     Royal Bank said the service offers cuts of up to 75 pct on standard brokerage commissions, toll-free, up-to-the-minute stock quotes, and margin loans in U.S. or Canadian dollars at competitive rates.
