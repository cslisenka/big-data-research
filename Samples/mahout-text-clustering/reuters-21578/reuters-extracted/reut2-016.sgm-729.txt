WHITE HOUSE SAYS SHULTZ TRIP MAY LEAD TO SUMMIT

President Reagan's chief of staff said a decision on a new U.S.-Soviet summit could emerge from Secretary of State George Shultz' Moscow talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.     Chief of Staff Howard Baker noted Reagan's invitation to Kremlin chief Mikhail Gorbachev to visit the United States, made at their first summit in Geneva in November, 1985, was still on the table.     "I would not be surprised to see that subject discussed by the secretary of state and the Soviet Foreign Minister," Baker told reporters.     "I would not be surprised to see some sort of decision result from those conversations."  Reuter &#3;
