CHINA FOREST FIRES FLARE AGAIN

Forest fires in north-east China had flared again, threatening settlements and virgin forests so far untouched by the blaze, the official press said.     The New China News Agency said eight new fires had been discovered in the Inner Mongolia region and were rapidly spreading north and west. It said rain forecast for the region was expected to help contain them.     The China Daily said fires near the town of Tahe to the east had re-kindled and were moving towards nearby logging camps. Soldiers have been called in to fight the blaze.     The fires which began on May 6 have killed 191 people.  REUTER &#3;
