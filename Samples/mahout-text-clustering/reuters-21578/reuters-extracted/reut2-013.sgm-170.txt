CONAGRA <CAG> TO PURCHASE 500,000 COMMON SHARES

ConAgra Inc said it will buy 500,000 shares of the company's common stock in the open market.     This continues Conagra's program of acquiring treasury stock to meet stock option, incentive plan and preferred stock conversion obligations, it said.     Conagra said its purpose is to use treasury shares for these purposes rather than issuing new shares so that earnings per share won't be diluted. The company said this is not a buy-back program to reduce shares and common equity.     Conagra said it has 67.4 common shares outstanding.  Reuter &#3;
