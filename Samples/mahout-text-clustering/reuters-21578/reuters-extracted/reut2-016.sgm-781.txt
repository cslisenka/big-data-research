EC PREPARES MOVES TO STOP JAPAN DEFLECTING EXPORTS

The European Community (EC) is ready to take measures to ensure that Japanese exports expected to be effectively excluded from the U.S. Market from today are not diverted to the EC, a spokesman said.     President Reagan is expected to announce later today the imposition of 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods ranging from computers and television sets to power tools and photographic film.     The spokesman for the EC executive Commission said representatives of member states last Friday agreed a series of measures to prevent Tokyo deflecting exports to the EC.     The spokesman declined to detail the measures, saying they were technical, and the Commission would decide their precise content depending on the exact details of the measures announced by Reagan.     The EC fears Tokyo will step up exports to it of a range of products including calculating machines, measuring instruments, small televisions, tapes and some machine tools as a result of the U.S. Measures.     But the spokesman said there was thought to be ample time to put the countermeasures in place after the Easter holiday.     He noted the probable outline of Reagan's announcement and its date have been known for some time.     The Japanese manufacturers of goods likely to be affected by the announcement are thought to have been stepping up their exports to the United States in recent weeks in order to beat the April 17 deadline, he noted.     They were therefore unlikely to have stocks available for export to the EC immediately, he said.  REUTER &#3;
