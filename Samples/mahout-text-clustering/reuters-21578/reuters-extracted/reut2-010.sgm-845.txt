LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE REVISES FT-SE CONSTITUENTS

The London Stock Exchange announced three changes to stocks included in the FT-SE 100 share index after a regular quarterly revision of its constituents.     Recently privatised British Airways Plc, the 70th of the top 100 U.K. Companies by market capitalisation, is included from next quarter, while Argyll Group Plc and British and Commonwealth Holdings Plc return to the index after acquisitions, and rate 44th and 66th respectively.     A statement said Imperial Continental Gas Association may be among three firms excluded if a proposed split in its operations goes through.  Reuter &#3;
