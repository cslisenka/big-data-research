STOCK EXCHAGE SAYS NO QUESTION OF HALTING TRADING

A spokeswoman for the London Stock Exchange said there was no question of trading being suspended because of the unprecedented three-day drop in prices, which has seen almost 23 pct wiped off share values.     Trading on the Hong Kong market has been called off until Monday because of the steep slide on Wall Street amid panic selling on all the world's stock exchanges.     The Tokyo market was 14.9 pct off last night after a huge 508 point (22.5 pct) fall on Wall Street yesterday.     The Stock Exchange said although the Stock Exchange Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system was working perfectly, "fast market" conditions may pevail periodically.     A "fast market" indicator is displayed at the bottom of the SEAQ screen when the huge volume of activity is delaying prices from entering the system, making screen prices lag behind the prevailing market.     Such conditions are reviewed every 30 minutes and at 1000 GMT were withdrawn and all on screen prices became firm.     The Exchange said the mandatory quote period will still end at 1600 GMT but depending upon trading activity the market indices may again be calculated up to 1630 GMT instead of the usual 1600 GMT.     At 0945 GMT the FTSE 100 share index was down 259.1 points at 1,793.2, 12.6 pct lower so far today.  REUTER &#3;
