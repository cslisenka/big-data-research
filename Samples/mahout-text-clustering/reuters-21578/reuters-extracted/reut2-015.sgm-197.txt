COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE

A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.     Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally Colombia's major export.     The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
