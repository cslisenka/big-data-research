U.S. CONGRESS STILL ANGRY WITH JAPAN - ABE

Special Japanese envoy Shintaro Abe said in a brief interview with Reuters that the feeling in the U.S. congress is "very severe" against Japan.     However, Abe said he believed that neither Congress nor the Reagan administration wants to undermine relations with Japan.     He said the Reagan administration showed "relative understanding" of how Japan is trying to alleviate its U.S. trade imbalance. Abe said he was convinced "Congress and the administration had the same view that the relationship between Tokyo and Washington should not be undermined."  Reuter &#3;
