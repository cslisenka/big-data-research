TAIWAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES SHARPLY IN MARCH

Taiwan's industrial production index, base 1981, rose 14.21 pct to 162.19 in March from a revised 142.01 in February, and 7.19 pct from March 1986, the Economic Ministry said.     The February figure was revised from a preliminary 140.06.     A ministry official said the March index stood at its highest level since the 169.94 set in December 1986.     He attributed the increase to rising production of textiles, wooden and bamboo products, plastics, machinery, electronics, transportation equipment, mining and house construction.  REUTER &#3;
