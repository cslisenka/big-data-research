DRUG INDUSTRY ATTACKED ON ASPIRIN ISSUE

Elements of the drug industry endangered the lives of children by pressuring the government to delay a now common warning on the link between aspirin and an often fatal disease, a doctor said.     The warning involving Reye's Syndrome has since been required on aspirin products under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directive of one year ago, and now appears on the labels of aspirin and aspirin-containing products.     The industry under government coaxing began voluntarily printing warning labels in mid-1985.         But in an editorial in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr Edward Mortimer of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland said some aspirin manufacturers misled physicians and acted irresponsibly in opposing the warning for several years before then.     Mortimer's criticism was prompted by a new government study published in the same issue of the Journal which said it had found a "strong association" between aspirin and Reye's Syndrome.     Reye's Syndrome, which kills about 20 per cent of its victims, strikes following chicken pox, influenza and other  illnesses. Symptoms include lethargy, belligerence and excessive vomiting. Those who survive sometimes suffer brain damage.     Reuter &#3;
