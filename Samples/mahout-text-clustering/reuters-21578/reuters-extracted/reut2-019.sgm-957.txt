SCOTT PAPER <SPP> SEES IMPROVED EARNINGS

Scott Paper Co, one of the leaders in the tissue and coated paper business, said it expects 1987 earnings to be between 5.75 dlrs and 6.25 dlrs a share, within the range proscribed by most Wall Street analysts.     "We have put together five or six years of pretty respectable growth and three consecutive years of record earnings and I see no reason why this growth pattern should be interrupted," Scott's chairman and chief executive officer Philip Lippincott told Reuters in an interview.     Last year, the company reported earnings of 4.96 dlrs a share, reflecting the impact of a a strike at its Mobile, Alabama, plant.     Earlier today, Lippincott outlined his bullish growth scenario for analysts, emphasizing that the company is dealing with the growing capacity in the industry by developing new products and modernizing plants. He said that capacity increases in the industry, particularly tissue paper, have stymied price hikes but Scott has boosted sales by providing more distinctive products that meet the needs of consumers.     "Scott Paper has shown tremendous growth in the last five years, but I think that improvement is largely unappreciated by the market," said analyst Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers who noted that the stock is selling at a relatively low price/earnings ratio.     "They have been striving for a return on equity of 14 to 17 pct, but today they were talking about a much higher objective. They are raising their financial objectives," Chao said.     Sales of consumer products increased about four pct last year and showed growth of about five pct pace in the first quarter, eclipsing the overall industry wide sales pace of less than two pct, Lippincott said.     "The most favorable thing I came away with today is that their Sommerset, Maine, plant which makes number four coated paper, is sold out through September. That means their coated paper business is looking particularly good," said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Group Inc.         Analyst George Adler of Smith Barney was equally optimistic. "They don't have anything that is going to set the world on fire right now but I am at a loss to find anything negative either," Adler said.     He said Scott Paper is continuing to gain market share by emphasizing their strategy and developing distinctive products.     Lippincott also noted that the company stands to gain from the depressed level of the dollar. "The bottom line impact of a lower dollar was about 15 cts a share in 1986, and we could have a similar impact this year," he said.  Reuter &#3;
