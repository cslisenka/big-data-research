TOWNSEND FERRY INQUIRY TOLD BOW DOORS TO BLAME

The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which around 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly caused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a British government inquiry was told.     Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the opening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy that this was "the only tenable explanation."     The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by Townsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiary European Ferries Group.     Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said the inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in calm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when water poured into the car deck.     "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of that was that the doors were open, he said.     Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to close either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should have been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover, despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that the doors were to be closed and kept closed.
