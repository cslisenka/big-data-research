UK SEEKS WINDING UP OF JAMES TENNANT COMMODITIES

The U.K. Government said it would seek the compulsory winding up of James Tennant Commodities Ltd on grounds of public interest and that details would be heard in the High Court on November 18.     A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said that James Tennant was relatively small and that its activities had concentrated on allowing investors to participate in pooled trading schemes in commodity futures.     No application had been made for the appointment of a provisional liquidator in the case, he added.  Reuter &#3;
