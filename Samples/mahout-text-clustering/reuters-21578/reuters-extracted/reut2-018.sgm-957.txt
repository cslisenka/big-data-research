CORRECTED - CRAZY EDDIE <CRZY> MAY BE DOWNGRADED

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade Crazy Eddie Inc's 81 mln dlrs of B-1 convertible subordinated debentures.     Moody's cited Crazy Eddie's reduced profitability, recent acquisition proposals for the company that could increase debt leverage, and an uncertain earnings outlook.     The agency said its review would consider the company's concentration in the highly competitive New York marketplace, as well as Crazy's ability to maintain adequate bank financing.     Moody's corrects amount of debt from 65 mln dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
