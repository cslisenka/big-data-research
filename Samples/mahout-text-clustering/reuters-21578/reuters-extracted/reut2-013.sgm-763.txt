CAMBRIDGE BIOSCIENCE <CBCX> TO START AIDS TESTS

Cambridge BioScience Corp said it received Federal Drug Administration approval on its "Investigational New Drug" filing to begin human clinical trials of its second generation diagnostic test for AIDS.     The company said it anticipates the test may be released to worldwide markets by late 1987 or early 1988.     Cambridge BioScience also said it expects to file soon an "Investigational New Drug"  with the FDA on its screening test for detecting AIDS antibodies.     This test, which is being evaluated in emergency situations in several African nations, does not require highly trained technicians nor instrumentation, according to the company.      Cambridge BioScience explained that the filing for human clinical trials for AIDS that received FDA approval, utilizes recombinant-DNA technology to detect and screen antibodies in blood or serum of patients infected with the AIDS-causing virus.     The other separate planned filing with the FDA is a revolutionary, five-minute latex agglutination screening test for detecting AIDS antibodies, the company said. This test, utilizes latex beads coated with CBC's recombinant antigen which attract and hold AIDS antibodies, forming clusters (agglutination), which indicates a positive result.  Reuter &#3;
