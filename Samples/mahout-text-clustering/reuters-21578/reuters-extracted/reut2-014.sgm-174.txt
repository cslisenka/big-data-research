DOLLAR STEADY IN LATE PARIS TRADING

The dollar was steady on the day but slightly down on yesterday's late range in very quiet trading with operators generally opting for caution ahead of this week's monetary meetings in Washington, dealers said.     The dollar was quoted at a late 6.0640/70 francs after a fix at 6.0620, an early 6.0565/90 and yesterday's late 6.0710/30.     The mark was quoted at a late 332.69/71 francs per 100 after a fix at 332.70, an early 332.72/75 and last night's 332.70/72 range.  REUTER &#3;
