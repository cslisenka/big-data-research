PROXMIRE SAYS FSLIC CONFERENCE SET FOR NEXT WEEK

Senate Banking committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, said a conference will be held with the House Banking committee next week on a bill to refinance the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.     The Senate has passed a 7.5 billion dlr FSLIC refinancing, while the House approved five billion dlrs in new funds. The Senate bill also bars new bank services until next March and bans so-called non-bank banks, provisions the House opposes.     FSLIC is virtually out of money to help ailing thrift institutions, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  Reuter &#3;
