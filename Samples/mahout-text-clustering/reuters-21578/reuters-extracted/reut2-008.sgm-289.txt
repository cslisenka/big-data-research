ROSTENKOWSKI URGES HONESTY IN FUTURES INDUSTRY

U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Congress would more readily respond to the needs of the U.S. futures industry to be internationally competitive if the industry showed a willingness to do its business honestly.     Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association that if other countries were relaxing futures regulations "because ours are being tightened, so that they can take a competitive advantage, I think we (Congress) have a responsibility to keep you out in front."     But he warned the futures leaders that they "have a more important reponsibility to do your business honestly. You can't ignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity."     There have been reports recently of futures traders placing their own orders ahead of clients'. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is considering curbing the right of traders in the Standard and Poor's 500 pit to trade for their own and clients' accounts.     "If we can see that there is a responsible response from people in your industry, we will be the first there to help." he said.  Reuter &#3;
