AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS URGED TO RESTRAIN PROFITS

Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called on businessmen to hold their salaries and profit margins as part of his campaign for economic restraint.     In a speech to the National Press Club, Hawke said business "must not puncture the spirit of community restraint" evident in low wage increases and suppressed consumer demand.     Hawke said the Federal Government would coordinate with State administrations to monitor prices and profit margins.     "At a time when a concerted national effort to restrain costs is required, profit margins should not be increased," he said.     Direct price control did not appeal to the government, but it would act to ensure market forces operated fairly and businesses were reminded of their obligations to Australia, Hawke said.     The government would demonstrate its commitment with spending cuts in its May 14 economic statement, he said.     It would also limit increases in government excises normally indexed to inflation to about six pct, Hawke said.  REUTER &#3;
