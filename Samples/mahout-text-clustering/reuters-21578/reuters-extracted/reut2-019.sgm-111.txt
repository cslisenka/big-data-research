TRI-STAR PICTURES <TRSP.O> GRANTED RELIEF

Tri-Star Pictures Inc said it won permanent relief from various provisions of the 1952 Consent Judgment and 1980 Order that apply to the Loews' Theatre Circuit, which Tri-Star acquired last December.     It said the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed to permit exhibition of Tri-Star motion pictures in loews theaters and to allow Tri-Star to conduct its business other than with Loews free from restructions of the court's earlier orders.
