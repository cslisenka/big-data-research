BOEING PROPOSES WESTLAND DEAL

Boeing Co <BA.N> said its Boeing Vertol helicopter unit proposed that U.K. Helicopter maker <Westland Plc> should build up to a third of all future Chinooks for Britain's airforce.     A Boeing statement made here said the work would involve up to 12,500 man-hours per machine, and solve some of Westland's short-term workload problems. It comes amid speculation that Britain may pull out of the European EH-101 project, with the possibility of up to 2,000 Westland job losses.     Westland was rescued last year by United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> and Fiat Spa <FIAT.MI>.  Reuter &#3;
