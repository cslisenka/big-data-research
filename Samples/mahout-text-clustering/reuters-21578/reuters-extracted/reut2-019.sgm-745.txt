LAST PRIVATE URUGUAYAN BANK MERGES WITH STATE BANK

The board of directors of the last entirely private Uruguayan bank, La Caja Obrera, has approved its merger with a state-owned bank due to a severe financial crisis, a bank statement said.     It said the Caja Obrera would merge with the Banco Pan de Azucar. The move was decided by the board of the Banco de la Republica, the state bank that since 1985 has had control the Banco Pan de Azucar.     La Caja Obrera said the move aimed "at assuring its normal and stable operation, with a full guarantee for the people holding deposits as well as clients and employees."     La Caja Obrera was the last entirely private Uruguayan bank. The Banco Pan de Azucar after being taken over by the Banco de la Republic in 1985 carried out a similar merger operation with the Banco de Italia.  Reuter &#3;
