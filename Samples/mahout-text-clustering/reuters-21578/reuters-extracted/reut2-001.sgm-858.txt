IMPORT TAX LIFTED ON CAPITAL GOODS

Argentina's Idustry and Foreign Trade Secretary announced the lifting until December 1989 of import taxes on capital goods not produced in the country.     Roberto Lavagna in a news conference also said Argentina would create a special programme for promoting industry and was studying a system of temporary, automatic and generalised admission of goods from neighbouring Brazil.     Lavagna said the measures were in line with an adjustment in economic policy to stall a new upsurge in inflation. The government last week froze prices and wages and devalued the Austral six pct against the dollar.  Reuter &#3;
