COLECO <CLO> SUBORDINATED DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Strandard and Poor's Corp said it cut to CCC-plus from B-minus Coleco Industries Inc's 300 mln dlrs of subordinated debt.     The company's implied senior debt rating is B.     S/P said the action reflected significant deterioration in capital structure and financial flexibility following Coleco's 111 mln dlr net loss in fiscal 1986. The agency attributed the loss to a falloff in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.     Coleco had negative equity of 7.7 mln dlrs at year-end 1986, S/P noted. Future operating performance depends on several new products with untested earnings potential.  Reuter &#3;
