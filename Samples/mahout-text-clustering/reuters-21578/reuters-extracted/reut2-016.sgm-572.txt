PICTEL CORP <PCTL.O> CHANGES NAME

PicTel Corp said it has changed its name to PictureTel Corp, effective immediately.     It said Pacific Telesis Grouyp <PAC> had threatened legal action if it did not cease the use of the name PicTel, alleging that it conflicted with Telesis' trademark PACTEL.     The company said Telesis will reimburse it for some expenses of the name change, which was approved by shareholders at the annual meeting last week.  Reuter &#3;
