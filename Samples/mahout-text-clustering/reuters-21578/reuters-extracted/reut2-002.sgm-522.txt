ICN <ICN> SUBJECT OF CLASS ACTIONS

Two separate class action lawsuits were filed against ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc and its Viratek Inc <VIRA> subsidiary, charging the companies with disseminating allegedly false and misleading information regarding the company's drug Virazole, which is being tested as a possible treatment for AIDS.     The suit, filed in Federal Court here on behalf of ICN shareholders, charges that disclosures made by ICN over about the past year encouraged the investing public to believe that Virazole was a promising drug of major importance and did not disclose serious adverse side effects, court documents said.     An ICN spokesman declined comment on the lawsuits. Attorneys for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment.     Virazole, also known as ribavirin, is undergoing extensive testing as a possible treatment for AIDS-related illnesses.     The drug, which is available in a number of countries outside the United States, has been approved by the FDA for use domestically in aerosol form as a treatment for an infection that strikes young children, called respiratory syncytial virus.     The FDA and a house subcommittee are conducting their own separate probes into whether ICN withheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the antiviral drug.     The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the company.  Reuter &#3;
