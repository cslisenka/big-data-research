MOODY'S UPGRADES TEXAS AIR <TEX> UNIT'S DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it upgraded 475 mln dlrs of debt of Continental Airlines Inc, a unit of Texas Air Corp.     Raised were the unit's senior secured Denver industrial revenue bonds to B-1 from Ca and subordinated debt to B-3 from C.     Moody's said the action recognizes the airline's reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, risks associated with its substantial financial leverage and unpredictable cash flow.
