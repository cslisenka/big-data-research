GENERAL ELECTRIC <GE> SELLS RIGHTS TO TECHNIQUE

General Electric Co said <BioReactor Technology Inc> obtained its rights to an experimental technique for analyzing blood samples to detect disease antibodies.     General Electric said BioReactor will attempt to develop test market kits from the advances made by General Electric.     General Electric said it granted the rights to BioReactor because the innovation, first announced in 1972, did not fit into the company's long-range product plans.     In exchange for the patent, GE said it will receive an unspecified interest in the company.                  Reuter &#3;
