U.K. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CAPITAL SPENDING SEEN UP

Capital spending in the U.K. Chemical industry is expected to rise to 1.4 billion stg this year, a three pct increase on the 1986 level after inflation, the Chemical Industry Association said.     A further increase to 1.52 billion stg is expected in 1988, but there will be a decline to 1.38 billion in 1989, the association found in its latest investment intentions survey.     Even so, the estimated total fixed capital spending for the 1987-89 period of 4.3 billion is a real spending increase of six pct on the previous three years, the report said. Eighty-one firms took part in the survey.  Reuter &#3;
