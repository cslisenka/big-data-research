NEWMONT GOLD <NGC> FILES FOR PUBLIC OFFERING

Newmont Gold Co said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed public offering of five mln shares of common plus an over-allotment option of 500,000 shares.     Newmont Gold said the newly registered shares would represent about 5.2 pct of the 105 mln shares outstanding after the share issue. It said it will use proceeds to repay the long-term debt it owes to its parent, Newmont Mining Corp <NEM>, and for general corporate purposes.     Newmont Mining will continue to own about 90 pct of Newmont Gold after the offering.     Newmont Gold said four mln shares will be offered initially in the U.S. by a U.S. underwriting group and one mln shares will be offered initially outside the U.S by an international underwriting group.     It said Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, Lazard Freres and Co and Salomon Brothers Inc and their affiliates will be co-managers of both underwriting groups.  Reuter &#3;
