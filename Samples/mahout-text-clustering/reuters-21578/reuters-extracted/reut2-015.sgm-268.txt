MINNETONKA <MINL> NOT PART OF UPJOHN <UPJ> SUIT

Minnetonka Inc said that neither its Foltene hair treatment nor its European supplier, Crinos Industria Farmacobiologica SpA, are named or involved in action filed by Upjohn Co.     Earlier today, Upjohn said it filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission requesting an investigation of infringement of its patent for the drug, Minoxidil, used in its treatment for baldness.     Minnetonka said it decided to make a statement to "dispell any association it may be involved" with the suit. Foltene does not use compositions of Minoxidil, it said.  Reuter &#3;
