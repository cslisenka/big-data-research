NYSE RULE COULD AFFECT TRADING IN LONDON

An existing New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of its members in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sources at the London Exchange said.     This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes ahead with plans to close its trading floor.     The London Exchange sources were commenting on press reports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from trading on the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periods when the NYSE was open.     The London exchange is seeking clarification.     London Exchange sources said the possibility of restrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule which requires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess a trading floor.     Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that it planned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floor for traded options, because almost all business is now being done by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.     This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring of the market on October 27. The demise of the traditional Stock Exchange floor has been widely expected, though no date has been set as yet.     Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule could well be reached, partly because the interests of U.S. Securities dealers are not all identical.     Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointing out, among other things, that the expansion of global trading needs to be based on reciprocal arrangements.     NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the London Exchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage over non-NYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the London Exchange, market sources said.
