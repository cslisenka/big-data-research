CBS INC <CBS> CHIEF EXPLAINS NEWS STAFF CUTS

The need to eliminate "inefficiencies and redundancies" was behind the decision to dismiss more than 200 employees at CBS News, according to a memo from Laurence Tisch, chief executive officer of CBS Inc.     CBS made public the memo to employes in which Tisch sought to re-assure news employes that news divison will have the resources to "serve the needs of the public" in the future.     Tisch said he accepted recommendations of the management of CBS News that 10 pct of the work force be trimmmed. "It was not an assignment that anyone relished or that I enjoyed giving them," he said.  Reuter &#3;
