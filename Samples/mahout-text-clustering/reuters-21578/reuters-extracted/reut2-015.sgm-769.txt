S/P MAY DOWNGRADE GENERAL INSTRUMENT <GRL>

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may downgrade the A-2 commercial paper of General Instrument Corp.     S and P cited the firm's 80 mln dlr loss for fiscal 1987 and a 90 mln dlr loss on discontinued micro-electronic and opto-electronic businesses and venture investments.     These losses, coupled with restructuring and re-evaluation actions, have led to poor earnings and cash flow since fiscal 1985. Stockholders equity fell 25 pct since fiscal year-end 1984 to a 465 mln dlr pro forma level, S and P said.     S and P said it will assess the effects of management's restructuring plans on credit quality and profit improvement.  Reuter &#3;
