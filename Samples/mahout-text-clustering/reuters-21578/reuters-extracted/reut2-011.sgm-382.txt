U.S. SENATE LEADER BLASTS REAGAN LEADERSHIP

Senate majority leader Robert Byrd said President Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway construction bill does not show leadership.     "Government by veto is not leadership," the West Virginia Democrat told reporters. "It's confrontation."     He said Reagan "is attempting to show he's back and rehabilitated by vetoing a very important bill."     The House is expected to override the veto today, but the outcome is uncertain in the Senate. Byrd said he is not sure when the bill would go before the Senate if the House overrides, but anticipated action this week.  Reuter &#3;
