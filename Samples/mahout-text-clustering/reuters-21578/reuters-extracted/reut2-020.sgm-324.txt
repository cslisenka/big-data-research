NO WHITE HOUSE PANIC ON MARKET, SPOKESMAN SAYS

The White House reacted calmly to the stock market situation, saying there was no crisis atmosphere and no action planned.     Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he had no information about special White House working groups or other actions that might indicate a feeling of crisis.      "There is not one," he said.     He said President Reagan had not scheduled any meeting with Treasury Secretary James Baker, now en route form Europe.     At the same time Fitzwater welcomed the action of major banks in rescinding increases in the prime interest rate.  Reuter &#3;
