TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS

The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.     But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts.     Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers.     But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp <GM>, Ford Motor Co <F> and Chrysler Corp <C>.     Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler.     And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses.  more &#3;
