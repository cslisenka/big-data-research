CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES CLOSE STRONG IN NEW CROP

CBT soybean futures closed on a strong note in new crop, showing gains of 4-3/4 to 9-1/4 cents per bushel in moderate trade. May settled at 5.04-1/2 dlrs after posting a 5-1/2 cent range, with November at 5.04-3/4.     Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basis values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support futures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in the weekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.     The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish, which could limit declines when South American sales begin to pick up later this month, they added.     A local house steadily bought new crop November, with another local house spreading July/Nov, pit brokers said.  Reuter &#3;
