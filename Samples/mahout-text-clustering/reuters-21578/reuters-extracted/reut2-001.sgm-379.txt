ITT <ITT> CONSIDERING STOCK REPURCHASE

ITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a repurchase of some shares.     "We are considering that as a very important way to increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market.     ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share a year ago.     Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares being studied for repurchase.     "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988," Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any other time in our history - at least with me."     Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s.    Last year, the company transferred its European telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V.     ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture.     Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year, Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small companies was recently concluded.     "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock transfers.     Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March.     Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of the sharp appreciation in its stock price.         Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year ago.     Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln dlrs, to 315 mln dlrs, while natural resources increased 10 mln dlrs, to 73 mln dlrs, the company said.      Reuter &#3;
