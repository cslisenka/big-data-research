BOLIVIAN POLICE DISPERSE UNEMPLOYED MINERS

Police fired tear gas to disperse 1,000 unemployed miners blocking the route of West German President Richard Weizsaecker's motorcade to La Paz, Bolivian Information Minister Herman Antelo said.     "They were forced to use tear gas to disperse the miners because they blocked the West German president's motorcade into the city," Antelo told journalists last night after the incident. Weizsaecker began a four-day visit here.     The demonstrators were part of about 20,000 miners -- about two-thirds of the total mining workforce -- laid off by the government to streamline the deficit-ridden state mining firms.  REUTER &#3;
