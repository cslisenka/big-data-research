NYSE CLARIFIES TRIPLE WITCHING PROCEDURE

The New York stock exchange said its rules for triple expiration Friday permit entering arbitrage-related market-on-close orders in the final 30 minutes of trading providing they are on the other side of imbalances and providing they open positions.     The NYSE clarified a statement released yesterday in which it detailed procedures to be followed this Friday when stock index options, index futures and individual stock options expire simultaneously. The NYSE said it will not allow a market-on-close order after 1530 EST Friday that increases or liquidates an existing arbitrage position.     The NYSE in cooperation with the Securities and Exchange commission will publicize imbalances of 10,000 or more shares in the 50 stocks beginning at 1530 EST Friday. In the final 30 minutes of trading Friday any market-on-close orders must be on the other side of the imbalance.  Reuter &#3;
