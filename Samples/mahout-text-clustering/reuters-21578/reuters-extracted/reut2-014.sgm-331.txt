Three months delivery ended the afternoon ring at 301.50 stg, up 2.50 stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close, and the dollar equivalent ended around 484 dlrs a tonne.     The cash metal buying widened the backwardation to around seven at one stage from three stg a tonne yesterday.  REUTER &#3;
