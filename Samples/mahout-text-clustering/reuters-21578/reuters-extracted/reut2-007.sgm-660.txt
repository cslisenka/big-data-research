BELGRADE UNIONS HIT PAY FREEZE, STRIKES SPREAD

Belgrade trade union leaders have joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia.     Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions council, said last night the government would be responsible for the effects of the law imposing the wage freeze. The law, enacted February 27 and remaining in force until July 1, reimposed wage levels of the last quarter of 1986. Future pay raises were pegged to productivity. The move triggered resentment and widespread industrial unrest.     Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on strike in Belgrade. The government has officially reported 70 strikes throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have hinted at more.  Reuter &#3;
