PAKISTAN COMPLAINS ABOUT AFGHAN AIR RAIDS

Pakistan complained to the United Nations today that planes from Afghanistan attacked Pakistani villages last Thursday and Friday, killing 90 people and wounding 230 others.     "These wanton and barbarous attacks are unprecedented in the scale of the casualties inflicted and damage caused," Pakistan's acting U.N. representative Aneesuddin Ahmed said in a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.     Ahmed, who did not request any specific U.N. action, said the attacks took place immediately after the start of the current round of U.N.-sponsored talks on Afghanistan in Geneva and indicated that "the Kabul regime is deliberately aggravating tensions and vitiating the prospects of the talks."
