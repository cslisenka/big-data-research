ALFIN <AFN> DRUG MISLABELLED, SAYS FDA

Alfin Inc <AFN> said it has received a regulatory letter from the Office of Compliance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asserting that because of labelling and certain advertising claims its Glycel products are "new drugs" within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for which no approval has been obtained and are "misbranded" in their labelling.     The company said it understands that this action is part of an industry-wide investigation.
