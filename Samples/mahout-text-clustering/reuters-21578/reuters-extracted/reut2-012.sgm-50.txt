SENATE UPHOLDS REAGAN'S VETO BUT WILL REVOTE

The Senate voted to sustain President Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway and mass transit funding bill, but Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia called for a second vote to reconsider the outcome.     The first vote ended with 65 Senators voting for the bill and 35 voting to sustain the veto, two short of the two-thirds majority needed to override. One of those voting to sustain the veto was North Carolina Democrat Terry Sanford.  Reuter &#3;
