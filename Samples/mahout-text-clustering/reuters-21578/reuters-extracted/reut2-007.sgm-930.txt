OKC <OKC> SAYS APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS RULING

OKC Limited Partnership said the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has affirmed a partial summary judgment renedered against it and for Phillips Petroleum Co <P> by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. OKC said it plans to seek a rehearing.     The company said Phillips is due 21.5 mln dlrs plus interest to date under the trial court judgment, and OKC has 14.0 mln dlrs in reserves set aside to cover the loss. It said it has made the necessary financial arrangements to provide for the total amount of the judgment.     OKC said the court found no support for OKC's contention that there was a mutual mistake between it and Phillips' Aminoil subsidiary that required the reforming of a farmout agreement.  Reuter &#3;
