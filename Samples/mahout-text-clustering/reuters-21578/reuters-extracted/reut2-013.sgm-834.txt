CARGILL U.K. STRIKE ENDS

Cargill U.K. Ltd's oilseed processing plant in Seaforth, northwest England, will resume operations tomorrow morning following settlement of a labour dispute which has paralysed production there since December 19, a company spokesman said.     It is likely to resume deliveries of soymeal and oil within a couple of days. Force majeure had previously been declared for supplies up to, and including May, but the company will attempt to fulfill all outstanding contracts, the spokesman said.  Reuter &#3;
