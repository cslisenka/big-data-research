REAGAN SENDS CONGRESS FEDERAL CREDIT REFORM BILL

The White House said President Reagan would send to Congress today proposed legislation providing for sweeping reform of the budgetary treatment of the federal credit program.     Called the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1987, the proposal consists of a package of legislation and accompanying budget amendments, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.     He noted that in fiscal 1986 the federal government disbursed 42 billion dlrs in new direct loans and guaranteed loans totalling 159 billion dlrs.     Under the reform bill, Fitzwater said the subsidy element in direct loan and guaranteed loan programs would be established and Congress would appropriate the amount of the subsidy to the lending agency.     "This is kind of a truth in spending reform package," Fitzwater said.  Reuter &#3;
