ITALY EXPRESSES WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT BRAZIL

Italian Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria met Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro today and expressed Italy's willingness to support his efforts in trying to resolve Brazil's pressing debt problems.     Goria told reporters after meeting Funaro, who is in Rome on the fifth leg of a tour to seek governmental support for his efforts to solve Brazil's debt crisis, that Italy's expression of support was based on reason as much as sympathy.     "The problems of one country are also those of the rest so we should all work together to help solve them," Goria said. "It is in the interest of all to work for the future."  Reuter &#3;
