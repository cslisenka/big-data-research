AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OPENS MOROCCO OFFICE 

The African Development Bank (ADB) opened a regional office in Rabat which will cover Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan and Somalia.     Babacar N'Diaye, president of the Abidjan-based bank, said the regional office, headed by Tunisia's Hedi Meliane, will try to consolidate and diversify Arab-African relations, the Moroccan news agency MAP reported.     N'Diaye said the ADB intends to increase its capital by 200 per cent by next June. This will allow it to invest about eight billion dollars in the next five years, he said..  Reuter &#3;
