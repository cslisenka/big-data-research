Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded First Interstate Bancorp's 1.3 billion dlrs of debt because of higher levels of non-performing assets.     S and P also cited net charge-offs, especially in real estate, energy and consumer loans. However, the agency said First Interstate has high liquidity and is less vulnerable to Latin American credits than its peers.     Cut were the company's senior debt to AA-minus from AA and subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus.
