BULL TO GET 800 MLN FRANC CASH INFUSION

France's state-owned computer group Cie des Machines Bull <BULP.PA> is to receive a government cash infusion of about 800 mln francs in addition to an 800 mln bond issue with share warrants planned for April, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said.     The capital injection will be in two stages, the first this year and the second at the start of 1988, she said.     Earlier this month Bull reported a consolidated net 1986 profit of 271 mln francs compared with 110 mln in the previous year. It also cited a fall in debt and increasing productivity.  Reuter &#3;
