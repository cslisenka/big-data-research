MIDDAY WINNIPEG OILSEEDS HIGHER

Winnipeg oilseeds were higher, with rapeseed gaining 2.10 to 2.50 dlrs a bushel and flaxseed up 1.50 to 2.70.     Oilseeds were supported by the rally in the Chicago soy complex, trade sources said. Further, recently active producer selling subsided, while exporters provided underlying support in flaxseed and crushers bought rapeseed, they said.     Feed grain trade was quiet with locals and commission houses dominating activity.     Rye fell 0.10 to 0.20.     Barley ranged 0.40 lower to 0.40 higher. Oats ranged unchanged to 0.30 lower. Wheat fell 0.20 to 0.50.  Reuter &#3;
