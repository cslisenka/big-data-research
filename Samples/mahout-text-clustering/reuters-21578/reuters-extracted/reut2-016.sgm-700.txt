CANADA MINISTER SETS REVIEW OF ENERGY OPTIONS

Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced a series of conferences will be held across Canada to review the country's policy options in the energy sector.     "It is planned as a comprehensive review of Canadian energy issues, an examination of the present energy situation, an attempt to identify and evaluate our options for the future," Masse said in a speech at a luncheon in Toronto that was made available here.     The meetings, which will be chaired by Tom Kierans, President of McLeod, Young Weir Ltd, will begin in June in Calgary, Alberta and conclude in December in Montreal.     The energy minister did not elaborate on what, if any, federal legislation would result from the process.     A final report would be issued at the end of the conference sessions and Masse said he would be in a position to respond to the report at that time.     In his speech, however, Masse said he would prefer to see the government's energy policies retain a market base, but added government intervention was sometimes necessary.     "I believe most of us accept the importance of allowing the market to function with the greatest possible freedom and flexibility," he said.     "However, because of intervention of all kinds, a market as perfect as we would like to have does not exist in this imperfect world," Masses said.  Reuter &#3;
