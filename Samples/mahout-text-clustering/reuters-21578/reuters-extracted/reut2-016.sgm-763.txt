S.KOREA TO INVESTIGATE LARGE-SCALE STOCK INVESTORS

South Korea's Securities Supervisory Board has ordered securities houses to report by tomorrow the list of their clients holding shares worth 100 mln won or more, Board officials said.     They said the order was aimed at preventing large investors from manipulating the Seoul exchange to make illegal margin profits. "It was believed that such shareholders were responsible for overheating the market earlier this year," one official told Reuters. No further details were given.  REUTER &#3;
