HOME SHOPPING SAYS IT NOT INVESTIGATION TARGET

Home Shopping Network Inc <HSN> said, in response to published reports, that it is not the target of a formal Securities and Exchange commission investigation.

Co <CMCO> merger negotiations to determine the source of rumors that caused the stocks to rise prior to a public announcement in January.     Home Shopping said it cooperated fully and had no indication that the informal inquiry is being pursued.  Reuter &#3;
