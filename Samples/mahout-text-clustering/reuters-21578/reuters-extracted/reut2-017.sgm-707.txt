CANADA CORPORATE DEBT LOWEST IN FIVE YEARS

Canada's corporate debt burden is at its lowest point in five years but still exceeds pre-1981 recession levels, said a study by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce <CM.TO>.     The bank said the debt-equity ratio for all Canadian companies, excluding financial corporations, now averages 1.50, down from 1.70 in 1982, but higher than 1.47 in 1980.     "Five years of uninterrupted economic growth in Canada and the strength of the Canadian bond and stock markets, despite recent corrections, have led to a marked improvement in the financial health of most Canadian corporations," the bank said.         The bank said that manufacturing, construction, transportation, utility and service industries had improved their debt-equity ratios to 1977 levels. Mining, oil and gas companies were not performing as well due to low commodity prices, the bank added.     Canadian corporate financial ratios are also stronger than those in the U.S., the bank said. It said the 1981-82 recession led some Canadian companies to downsize and use resulting savings to cut floating rate debt, and others to shift to equity from debt financing.
