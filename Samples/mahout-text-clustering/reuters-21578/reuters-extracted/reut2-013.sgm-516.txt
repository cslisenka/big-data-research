MALAYSIAN CRUDE PALM OIL CLOSES BELOW HIGHS

Crude palm oil prices closed below the day's highs on late selling, prompted by talk that Pakistan passed on its tender for 6,000 tonnes of RBD palm oil for second half April shipment after having bought the same amount yesterday, dealers said.     Pakistan's presence and steadier overnight Chicago soyoil futures supported the market initially, they added.     April deliveries, south and central regions closed five higher at 752.50 and 750 ringgit per tonne respectively after highs of 757.50 while May south traded down to 750 from 755.     The refined palm oil market saw some renewed interest, with prices also higher initially. May and June RBD palm olein traded earlier at 332.50 dlrs per tonne, and May RBD palm oil at 318.
