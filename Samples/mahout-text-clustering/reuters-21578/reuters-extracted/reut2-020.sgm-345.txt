GREAT WESTERN <GWF> SEES LOWER 12 MTH EARNINGS

Great Western Financial Corp said 1987 12 month earnings will be lower than the earnings of 300.8 mln dlrs on revenues of 3.77 billion dlrs it reported for 1986.     The company cited a one-time write-off of its investment in the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp secondary reserve, a one-time higher federal tax rate, reduced loan sale volume, and the effect of rising short-term rates on margins as reasons for the expected decline.     In addition, the company cited a net-after tax loss of 2.4 mln dlrs from its leasing operation during the 1987 nine mth period as a reason for the anticipated earnings drop.     Earlier today, the financial services company reported earnings of 57.8 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 compared to earnings of 79.4 mln dlrs for the 1986 quarter, and 1987 nine months earnings of 195.8 mln dlrs compared to 1986 earnings of 228.9 mln dlrs.
