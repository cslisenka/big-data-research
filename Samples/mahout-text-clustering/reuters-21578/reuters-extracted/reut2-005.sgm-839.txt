CEREAL TRADERS SEEK TALKS WITH ANDRIESSEN ON EMS

The European Community cereal trade lobby Coceral has written to Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen asking for talks on ways of preventing their members losing money as a result of future realignments of currencies in the European Monetary System.     In the text of a letter made available to journalists, Coceral says some members suffered considerable losses on contracts entered into just before the last realignment in January.     This was because of an unforeseeable increase in monetary compensatory amounts (MCA's) for some member states, it says.     Coceral estimates losses sustained by West German traders who are its members at 8.05 mln marks.     It says Andriessen should work out new regulations to prevent a repetition of such losses as a result of future realignments.     A Coceral spokesman said problems had arisen when traders importing cereals from weak currency countries into those with strong currencies bought the weak currencies with which they were to pay for the cereals forward.
