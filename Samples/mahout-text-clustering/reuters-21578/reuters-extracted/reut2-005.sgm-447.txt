MOLECULON <MBIO> SEES NEW WAY TO KICK THE HABIT

Moleculon Inc said it successfully completed initial tests in animals of its Poroplastic transdermal nicotine delivery system to help smokers break the habit.     Transdermal systems are designed to deliver drugs through the skin in constant dosages.     The company said it is discussing licensing and marketing agreements for the product with a major international pharmaceutical firm, but did not identify the firm. It also said it retained Allen and Company, New York, as its financial advisor.  Reuter &#3;
