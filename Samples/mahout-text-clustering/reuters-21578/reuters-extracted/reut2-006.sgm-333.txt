MALAYSIA SAYS IT DEPOSITED FUNDS IN AILING BANK

The Malaysian government has deposited 405 mln ringgit with the financially troubled <Cooperative Central Bank Bhd> (CCB) since last October, Deputy Finance Minister Sabaruddin Chik said.     He told Parliament the government has always supported CCB. The statement is the government's first acknowledgment that it has put money into the bank.     CCB's management board has been changed twice since last June. It reported pretax profit of 10.57 mln ringgit in the half-year to June 30, 1986, down from 19.83 mln ringgit a year earlier. The bank did not release its net results.     New bank chairman Nik Hussein Abdul Rahman has said he asked police to investigate possible wrongdoing and malpractices related to loans made mainly to property developers and politicians.     The bank had a paid-up capital of 52.16 mln ringgit and deposits totalling 1.67 billion at June 30 last year.     Malaysia's Central Bank has rescued two large commercial banks, United Asian Bank Bhd and Perwira Habib Bank (Malaysia) Bhd, since late 1986.  REUTER &#3;
