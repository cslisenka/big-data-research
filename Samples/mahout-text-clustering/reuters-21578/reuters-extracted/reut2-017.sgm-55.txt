DENMARK'S NOVO INDUSTRI GETS SWISS SHARE LISTING

Danish-based insulin and enzymes producer Novo Industri A/S <NVO.CO> said in a statement that its "B" shares would be listed on stock exchanges in Zurich, Basel and Geneva from May 4.     The aim is to create broader European interest in Novo stock, currently listed in Copenhagen, London and New York, said the statement issued after yesterday's ordinary general meeting.     Novo said more than 50 pct of its B shares were owned by U.S. Investors. The new listings, the first by a Danish company on the Swiss exchanges, will not involve issuing of new share capital.
