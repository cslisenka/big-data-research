SINGAPORE TAX PACKAGE INTRODUCED TO AID ECONOMY

Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu in his budge speech introduced a tax package he said aims at consolidating economic recovery.     He imposed higher taxes on tobacco and liquor but introduced tax incentives to promote population growth and offshore services. In order to further accelerate development of the capital market and fund management activities, from the year of assessment 1988 income earned by Asian Currency Units and securities companies approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be taxed at a concessionary rate of 10 pct.     He said interest paid by Simex members to non-residents in respect of transactions in the deferred gold market will be exempt from withholding tax. This will make Singapore a more attractive place to carry out such transactions, he added.  Reuter &#3;
