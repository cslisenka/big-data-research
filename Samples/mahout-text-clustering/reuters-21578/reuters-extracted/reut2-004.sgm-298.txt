KODAK <EK> REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO PHOTOGRAPHY

Eastman Kodak Co said it will build a major facility here for the production of color film, reaffirming its commitment to its core photographic business.     Kodak said the plant will cost more than 200 mln dlrs to build and will be staffed by about 250 people who will be transferred from existing manufacturing operations. It said the plant should be operational by the fall of 1990.     Kodak said it does not intend to shut down any current capacity as anticipated growth in demand for photography products will "offset the additional capacity."     The company also said the facility will position it "well into the 21st century," in the photography business. It said the plant will initially produce color films for the professional and motion picture industry.     Kodak also said it will maintain its Rochester site as the center of its photographic technology operations. "We have been encourgaged that in recent years this community and New York state have been working hard to improve the business climate for manufucturing," said William F. Fowble, Kodak's sernior vice-presient and general manager of manufacturing. "We assume thesse efforts will continue."  Reuter &#3;
