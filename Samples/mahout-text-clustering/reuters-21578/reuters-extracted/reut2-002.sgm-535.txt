NYSE MEMBERS VOTE TO LIFT LIMIT ON PENALTIES

The New York Stock Exchange said its members overwhelmingly approved a rule change that elminates the limits on fines imposed as a result of disciplinary proceedings.     The NYSE said the amendment to its constitution, already approved by its board, must now be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.     The NYSE said it currently limits penalties to a maximum of 25,000 dlrs per charge against individuals and 100,000 dlrs per charge against firms.  Reuter &#3;
