SHAD WANTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION

Securities and Exchange Commission John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition of insider trading but thought action should wait until the Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case.     "I'd like the benefit of the Winans decision before deciding on a definition," Shad told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing.     Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column.     The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans' recommendation.     He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of the SEC's enforcement activities last year despite the publicity given to recent major cases.     "Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading," Shad said.     Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge  its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal with all types of securities fraud.     Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know when his successor would be named by President Reagan.  Reuter &#3;
