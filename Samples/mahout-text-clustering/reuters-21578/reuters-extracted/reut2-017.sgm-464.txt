IBJ AMORTIZES LOANS TO JAPAN LINE

The Industrial Bank of Japan <IBJT.T> (IBJ) amortized 68 billion yen worth of loans, including the write-off of an unspecified amount of loans, to the <Japan Line Ltd> group in the year ended March 31, an IBJ spokesman said.     He declined to comment on a report in the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun that it had written off loans worth 15 billion yen to Japan Line, one of the world's largest tanker operators.     Japan Line's current liabilities amounted to 68.98 billion yen at the end of September.     In December, Japan Line asked its creditor banks to shelve repayment of 124 billion yen of outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries following the yen's steep rise and the world recession in shipping.
