U.S. ELECTRONIC SALES FLAT IN 1986

U.S. electronic companies' sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the 228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic Association said.     Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1 billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of 1984, the AEA said.     AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures before trying to forecast the future.     "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector, are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade deficit with Japan," he said.     Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1 pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were 22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.     The association represents more than 2,800 firms that produce electronic goods and services.  Reuter &#3;
