CTC DEALER TO APPEAL CANADIAN TIRE DECISION

CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said it would appeal a previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding an Ontario Securities Commission decision to block CTC's bid for 49 pct of <Canadian Tire Corp Ltd> common shares.     CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, added that it also extended its tender offer to March 31 and was seeking approval to extend its bid while the appeal court heard the case.     It said Alfred and David Billes, two of Canadian Tire's controlling shareholders, backed the appeal and would seek leave to appeal while third controlling shareholder Martha Billes supported the appeal but would not join an appeal motion.
