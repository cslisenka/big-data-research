BYRD SAYS REAGAN MAY WIN HIGHWAY VETO FIGHT

Senate majority leader Robert Byrd said President Reagan may win his latest veto battle with Congress over a nearly 88 billion highway construction bill.     The West Virginia Democrat said it would be "tough" for the Senate to override the veto. Reagan is expected to announce he is rejecting the measure later today.     Byrd said it would be difficult for the Senate to overcome a White House public relations campaign against the bill.     The House, voting first, is expected to override it, House Republican Leader Bob Michel has said. It requires two houses to override a veto by two-thirds majorities.  Reuter &#3;
