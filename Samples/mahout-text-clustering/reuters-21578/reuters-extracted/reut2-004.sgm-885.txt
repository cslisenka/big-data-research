WALKER <WTEL> TO DISCONTINE MOBILE OPERATIONS

Walker Telecommunications Corp said the company has decided to discontinue operations of its Mobile Communications Division which will result in a one-time substantial loss for the fourth quarter and year.     For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 1985 Walker reported a net loss of 17,000 dlrs and net income of 175,000, respectively.     Walker said retail prices for mobile cellular telephones have declined dramatically to point where the company no longer believes that it can profitably participate in the market.  Reuter &#3;
