CONNECTICUT ENERGY <CNE>UNIT SEEKS HIGHER RATES

Connecticut Energy Corp said its Southern Connecticut Gas Co unit filed with state regulators a letter of intent to raise its rates by 2.7 pct, or about 4.2 mln dlrs, beginning in late 1987.     The company said it expects to file a formal application with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control within 60 days.     The company said a rate increase is needed to cover higher operating and maintenance expenses that have occurred since it last received a rate hike of three pct, or 4.8 mln dlrs, in January 1985.
