DUFF AND PHELPS UPGRADES PHILIP MORRIS <MO>

Duff and Phelps said it is upgrading to its highest level, Duff 1+ (one plus) from Duff 1, the rating on about 836 mln dlrs of Philip Morris Companies Inc commercial paper.     The change reflects the company's improvement in retiring debt incurred in the the acquisition of General Foods Corp, and the ability of both the tobacco and food product lines to generate cash flow, Duff and Phelps said.
