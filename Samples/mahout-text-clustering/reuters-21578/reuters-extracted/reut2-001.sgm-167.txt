ELECTROSPACE <ELE> GETS ARMY OK FOR CONTRACT

Electrospace Systems Inc said it was ordered by the U.S. Army to immediately proceed with the design and production of a computer-based control system for the army's tactical voice and data communications network, in a contract potentially worth 101 mln dlrs.     It said the order followed a favorable ruling by the General Accounting Office on two protests that earlier caused a stop work order on the 26.8 mln dlr contract, awarded last September. It said that order covers 59 mobile shelter-based systems and 44 remote terminals, with options for 279 mobile units and 178 remote units for a total of 101 mln dlrs.       Reuter &#3;
