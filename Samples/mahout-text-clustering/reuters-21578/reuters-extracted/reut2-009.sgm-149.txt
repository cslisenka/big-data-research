SINGAPORE SECURITIES MARKET CONSIDERING CHANGES

The Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd is looking at a new settlement and clearing system and a corporate disclosure format that would make financial data more readily available, George Teo, deputy chairman of the exchange, said.     He told a conference organised by the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd that Singapore wants to develop the fixed rate securities market. He said a state securities market, along the same lines as the U.S. Government securities market, will be developed to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.     Teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the way for companies to raise fixed rate funds.     Referring to a proposed change in the broking commission structure, Teo said the exchange is likely to introduce a sliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commission structure. He said the negotiated structure works against small investors, who play an important role in the market.     The market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange of Singapore increased to 42 billion U.S. Dlrs in January 1987 from 32 billion U.S. Dlrs in early 1986, he said.     Teo said the government has picked 15 companies to participate in a privatisation program which strives to create opportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrs worth of shares a year. It will try to increase alternative investment available to investors, he said.     He cautioned against problems in a more competitive securities market, adding that the possibility of insider trading is increased when securities dealing, corporate finance and investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof. But he said the future direction of Singapore's securities industry will be dictated by international trends.  REUTER &#3;
