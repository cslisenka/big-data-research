MORE RAIN IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES

The National Weather Service said a storm, centered off the east of Massachusetts early this morning, continued to produce rain across New England, and as far west as Michigan, Ohio and west Virginia. Some areas in the northeastern U.S. have yet to see the sun this month.     A flood warning remains in effect for small rivers in southern New Hampshire and extreme southwestern Maine. A flood warning is also in effect for interior Rhode Island, and central and northeastern Massachusetts.     A flood watch covers much of the rest of Massachusetts, eastern interior Connecticut and coastal Rhode Island, along with the southern half of Vermont, the White mountains of New Hampshire and much of southern Maine.     The storm off the Atlantic Coast has been very slow to move out to sea, and rain is likely to continue in northern New England into Wednesday.     Cool and wet weather has also prevailed in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas so far this month.     A few light rainshowers were over the lower Rio Grande Valley early this morning. Rainshowers were also widely scattered over the middle Mississippi Valley.     A cold front was bringing cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers to the northwestern U.S.     Skies remained clear in the north central U.S. Unseasonably warm temperatures prevailed across the north central states Monday afternoon. High temperatures in northern Minnesota were warmer than those in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.     Temperatures were in the 30s F early this morning in the central and southern Rockies, and the southern and central high Plains.     Temperatures were still in the 60s in south Florida, southern Arizona and southern California.  Reuter &#3;
