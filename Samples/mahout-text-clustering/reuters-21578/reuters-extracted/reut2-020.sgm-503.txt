NYSE SAYS NO MAJOR FIRMS REPORTING PROBLEMS

No major member firms of the New York Stock Exchange have reported any financial difficulties, NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said.     He said the only difficulty reported since the market fell 500 points yesterday was the problem encountered by a small firm, H.B. Shaine and Co Inc of Grand Rapids, Mich. which ceased operations.     "Our systems are doing extremely well," he told reporters.     He said NYSE executives have been conferring with senior staff members at the White House and officials of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other major Exchanges. He did not identify the officials.     In an effort to reduce the volatility in the market today, the NYSE temporarily suspended trading on the New York Futures Exchange. The NYFE reopened at 1315 EDT.     The NYSE said the reason for the suspension was that they were following the actions of other exchanges where futures were traded.     Traders expressed concern that further volatility caused by futures might threaten the financial health of other Wall Street firms.  Reuter &#3;
