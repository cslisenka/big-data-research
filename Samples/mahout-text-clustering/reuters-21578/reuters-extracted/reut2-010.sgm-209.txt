BRITAIN'S CENTRIST ALLIANCE GAINS IN LATEST POLL

Britain's centrist Alliance has gained further ground and now stands second to the ruling Conservatives according to a new public opinion poll, leaving the main opposition Labour Party trailing in third place.     The Gallup survey to be published in tomorrow's Daily Telegraph newspaper shows the Conservatives with a popularity rating of 37.5 pct, followed by the Social Democrat/Liberal Alliance with 31.5 pct and Labour with 29.5 pct.     A Marplan poll published in this morning's edition of the Today newspaper gave the Conservatives 36 pct against a tied figure of 31 pct each for Labour and the Alliance.     Last month a Marplan poll gave the Tories 38 pct, the Alliance 21 pct and Labour 37 pct.     The latest poll findings would, if translated into an election result, produce a hung parliament where no single party enjoyed an overall majority, analysts said.     That should dampen speculation of an early June election, they added.  Reuter &#3;
