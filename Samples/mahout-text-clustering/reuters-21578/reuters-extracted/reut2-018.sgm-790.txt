FRENCH FARMERS WORRIED BY FAILURE OF EC TALKS

France's leading farmer's union, the FNSEA, said it is worried that negotiations on the 1987/88 farm price package will now be tackled by European Community leaders who do not know the agricultural situation.     The leaders have no specialised knowledge of the farm dossier and have the tendency to sign compromises which are "too broad," union leader Raymond Lacombe said. But he added French Farm Minister Francois Guillaume had reason to reject a compromise which would have been negative for the farm sector.     EC ministers ended talks this morning having failed to get any agreement on agricultural prices for the 1987/88 farm year, which started on April 1 for certain products.     Lacombe said the French government should guarantee farmers' incomes until an agreement is reached.  Reuter &#3;
