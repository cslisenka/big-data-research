IRAQ SAYS IT CRUSHED IRANIAN ATTACK IN NORTH

Iraq said today its forces had crushed an Iranian attack on a strategic mountain peak in a rugged and snow-clad area of Iraqi Kurdistan.     The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps' 96th Brigade on "Karda Ku" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and 340 kms north of Baghdad.     INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not give Iraqi casualties.     The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Iran's week-old offensive in northeast Iraq.     Iran attacked across snow-capped peaks of northeastern Iraq last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid-1983.     The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraq's second city on the southern front of the 6-1/2-year-old conflict, after an Iranian cross-border offensive launched on January 9.     The political department head at Iraq's Defence Ministry, Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.     He said Tehran had done this "to make up for failure in the south and to encourage anti-Baghdad Kurdish rebels to support its troops."     Tehran has supported anti-Baghdad Kurdish guerrillas in operations against government positions and installations in northern Iraq.  REUTER &#3;
