MALAYSIAN POLICE DENY RACE RIOT RUMOURS

Malaysian police denied rumours of race riots in Kuala Lumpur after an armed man killed one person and injured two others in an attack on two petrol stations in a racially-sensitive area of the city.     A police statement broadcast over official Radio Malaysia called on the public not to listen to the rumours and go about their normal business.     "Everything is under control. It's only a small matter and there is no cause for alarm," a police spokesman told Reuters after confirming the shooting on Sunday night.      However, rumours that riots had broken out hit the stock market and shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange fell across the board in heavy nervous selling when the market opened this morning, brokers said.     Police said they cordoned off the district of Chow Kit and set up road blocks from midnight after the man, armed with a rifle, killed one Malay and injured another Malay and a Chinese. He set fire to one of the petrol stations.   REUTER &#3;
