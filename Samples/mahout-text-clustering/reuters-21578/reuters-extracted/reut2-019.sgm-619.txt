MAURITIUS COULD HAVE OFFSHORE BANKING BY JANUARY

Mauritian Finance Minister Seetanah Lutchmeenmaraidoo said the island's first offshore bank could open in January 1988.     The minister was announcing the creation of a committee of eight economists to look at ways of encouraging foreign investment, especially offshore banking.     The committee, part of the government's plans to make Mauritius an international financial centre, is expected to submit its recommendations within three months.     Lutchmeenmaraidoo also circulated a white paper on legislation to set up a stock exchange on the island.     He said the exchange would be a powerful instrument of economic democratisation and the legislation would include incentives to encourage shareholding by a wide public.     The government would also introduce a bill to protect investors and set up a vigilance committee with powers to suspend any company from the stock exchange, halt trading in its shares and take punitive measures for illegal practices.     The stock exchange would probably become fully operational in the next five to 10 years, he added.  REUTER &#3;
