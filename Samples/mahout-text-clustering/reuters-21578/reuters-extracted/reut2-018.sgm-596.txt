U.S. BUDGET COMPROMISE REACHED IN CONGRESS

Congressional Democratic leaders announced a compromise has been reached on a 1988 budget, paving the way for final approval of a trillion dollar spending plan.     House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd told a news conference that final congressional approval of the plan to reduce an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit next year to 134 billion dlr was expected next week.     The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both House and Senate but who have been stalemated for a month over different House and Senate budgets that passed earlier.     The budget proposes 19.5 billion dlrs in new taxes next year, 65 billion dlrs over a three year span.     It would cut President Reagan's request to spend 298 billion dlrs for defense in 1988 by about nine billion dlrs, but only if he accepts the proposed tax increase to pay for it.     If Reagan rejects the tax rise, which he has said he would, defense spending under the plan would drop automatically by about five billion dlrs, the leaders said.     Reagan's own budget was rejected by wide margins in both House and Senate by a combination of Democrats and his own Republican party who said it was unrealistic.  Reuter &#3;
