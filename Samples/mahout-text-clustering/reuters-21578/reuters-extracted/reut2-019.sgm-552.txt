DEGUSSA PLANS ONE-FOR-FIVE RIGHTS ISSUE

Degussa AG <DGSG.F> said it planned a one-for-five rights issue at 225 marks per share, raising nominal share capital by 61 mln marks, by the end of its current business year ending September 30.     The company said in a statement it would also raise nominal share capital by 20 mln marks in a share swap as part of its planned takeover of French medicine group <Laboratoires Sarget SA>.     The two capital measures will raise Degussa nominal share capital to 365 mln marks.     Degussa said last week it intended to buy 100 pct of the capital of the medical pharmaceuticals group Sarget, based in Merignac near Bordeaux.     Sarget had 1986 sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Italy of 730 mln French francs.     Degussa has not said how much it would pay for Sarget, but 20 mln marks nominal of 50-mark shares, at today's Frankfurt opening price of 494.70 marks, would be worth nearly 198 mln marks.     A 61 mln mark nominal capital increase at 225 marks would raise 274.5 mln marks.     Degussa said the 20 mln mark nominal capital increase would take the form of an issue of shares for a non-cash consideration. The April 10 annual meeting agreed that there would be no rights issue on this capital, which was already authorized but unissued.     The rights issue involving the 61 mln mark nominal capital increase will be led by Dresdner Bank AG. Following that capital increase, Degussa would be left with 19 mln marks of authorized but unissued capital, a Degussa spokesman said.     Part of the 274.5 mln marks from the rights issue would also be used for the Serget acquisition, he added.  REUTER &#3;
