CompuDyne Corp said its Robintech Inc unit expects to spend 300,000 to 350,000 dlrs on a study of a former plant site requested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.     The company said another potentially responsible party was also asked to share in the study. The plant, in Vestal, N.Y., has been designated as a Superfund site by the EPA.
