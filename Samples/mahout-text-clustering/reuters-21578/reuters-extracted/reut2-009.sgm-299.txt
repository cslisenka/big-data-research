H.K. OFFICIAL DEFENDS NON-PROSECUTION OF BOND

Hong Kong's Attorney General Michael Thomas said he decided not to prosecute Alan Bond, chairman of <Bond Corp International Ltd> (BCIL), for giving misleading information about the firm because the case was weak.     He told the Legislative Council there had been widespread misunderstanding, speculation and unfair distortion of the reasons for the decision.     "Even if there is evidence that tends to prove the necessary ingredients of an offence, a bare prima facie case is, generally speaking, not enough to warrant a prosecution," added Thomas.     The Attorney General's office said last month it will not prosecute Bond for his statements that the net asset value per share of properties owned by BCIL should be 2.60 H.K. Dlrs instead of 1.10 dlrs stated in the firm's prospectus.     The decision followed a public apology by Bond that his remarks were misleading about BCIL, owned 66.2 pct by the Australia based Bond Corp (Holdings) Ltd <BONA.S>.     Thomas dismissed a suggestion that he had compromised not to prosecute Bond if an apology was published but added: "its publication ultimately was a factor I took into account when subsequently I decided not to prosecute."
