GERMAN BANK SUPERVISOR CALLS FOR WIDER REGULATION

West German banking regulations must be expanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from new financing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office President Wolfgang Kuntze said.     Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedging price risks are not covered by current supervisory rules.     Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have to be disclosed.     Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks can continue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves against their own holdings of securities.     Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18 times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basis and Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny.     Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said.     Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervision can be found without having to change the law again.     The risk structure in banking is moving away from the model on which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said.     Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net but the safety net has become a little too small, he said.     Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to banking regulations, as these are still the subject of discussions between the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank.     He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for an international harmonisation of supervisory law and the German supervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation.     Nor would it get involved in international competition on minimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks from competitive disadvantages, he said.  REUTER &#3;
