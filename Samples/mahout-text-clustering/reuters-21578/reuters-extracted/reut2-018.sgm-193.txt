LAC <LAC> REAFFIRMS FORECAST FOR HIGHER NET

Lac Minerals Ltd reiterated it expected substantially higher 1987 profit and revenues than last year's earnings of 19.1 mln dlrs on 250.2 mln dlrs of revenues.     The 1986 results include the disputed Page-Williams mine at Hemlo, Ontario. A decision is imminent on Lac's appeal of a 1986 Ontario court decision ordering Lac to hand over the mine to International Corona Resources Ltd <ICR.TO>.     Lac chief executive Peter Allen told institutional investors that the anticipated stronger performance would come from strong operating results and an active revenue management program.         Lac said year-to-date gold production excluding the disputed Page-Williams mine was 134,000 ounces, in line with targeted 1987 production of 300,000 ounces. It said it expected an average realized price of 450 U.S. dlrs an ounce in full-year 1987.     It said its outstanding forward contracts at May 29 were 220,000 ounces of gold at average price of 439 U.S. dlrs an ounce, including 135,000 ounces maturing in 1987 at 482 U.S. dlrs an ounce.
