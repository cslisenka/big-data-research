MOODY'S SEES MORE LOSSES IN MORTGAGE INSURANCE

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it is likely that large underwriting losses will persist in the mortgage insurance industry for at least the next two years.     In its annual report on the mortgage insurance industry, Moody's said that in 1986 incurred losses increased by 21 pct over the dismal record posted the year before.     Moody's said the underwriting losses mainly reflected major economic forces, structural complications and the risk makeup of the industry. The rating agency said that, while mortgage insurance industry risk remains high, slow improvement appears likely.  Reuter &#3;
