HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES U.S. BUDGET CUTS

The House Budget Committee approved a package of 23 billion dlrs in taxes and budget cuts to reduce the 1988 budget deficit.     The 20-14 party-line vote by the Democratic-controlled committee sends the measure to the full House where House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage next week.     The package--including 12 billion dlrs in taxes President Reagan has vowed to veto--was put together by other committees under a new budget law requiring a 23 billion dlr cut in the deficit to scale down the 1988 budget deficit.
