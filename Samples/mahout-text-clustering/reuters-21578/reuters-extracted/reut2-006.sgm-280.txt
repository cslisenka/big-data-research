HARLEY-DAVIDSON <HDI> WANTS TARIFFS LIFTED

Harley-Davidson Inc said it is petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers.     Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to compete with the Japanese. It said President Reagan imposed the tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the administration the Japanese were eroding the U.S. motorcycle industry by flooding the market with its own models.     Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of the heavyweight motorcycle to 19.4 pct in 1986 from a record low 12.5 pct in 1983.  Reuter &#3;
