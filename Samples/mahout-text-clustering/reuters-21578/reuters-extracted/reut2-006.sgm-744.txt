WORLD FOOD PRODUCTION OUTSTRIPS POPULATION

World food production over the next decade will exceed population growth, but because of unequal distribution, many parts of the world will go hungry, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said.     In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee at a meeting later this month, FAO said: "The long term trends point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.     "Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the combined problem of low nutritional levels, rapidly rising populations, inadequate growth in both food production and incomes...," FAO said.     FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the committee, which meets between March 23 and April 1.     These included improving the international trading environment for agricutural commodities, reducing food surpluses in developed countries, conserving natural resources and speeding up the increase of food production in developing countries.
