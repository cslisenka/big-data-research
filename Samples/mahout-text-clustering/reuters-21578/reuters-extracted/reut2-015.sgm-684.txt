WALL ST. SCANDAL SAID TO REFLECT REAGAN ETHIC

A key U.S. lawmaker in the securities field said the insider trading scandal gripping Wall Street reflects the attitude of the Reagan administration.     "They don't ask the question, 'Is it right or is it wrong?' They ask the question, 'Can you pull it off?'" Rep Edward Markey (D-Mass) told a state securities administrators meeting here.     Markey, Chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee which oversees U.S. securities markets, said this ethic permeated Wall Street as well as the Reagan administration.     He cited as examples a number of administration officials tainted by charges of wrongdoing including ex-Reagan advisor Michael Deaver, former national security aide John Poindexter and former Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle.     Some Wall Street critics have blamed the insider trading scandal on the so-called "Yuppie mentality", in which young professionals strive for financial reward and neglect social values.     But Markey said the inspiration for this attitude came from the administration.  Reuter &#3;
