GENERAL ELECTRIC <GE> NEW JET ENGINE TESTED

General Electric said its unducted fan jet engine lived up to expectations in recently completed tests on a Boeing Co <BA> 727 airplane.     The engine, which contains two sets of counter-rotating fan blades, marks an advance over conventional engines built with ultra high bypass ducted fans. The testing was a joint effort of GE and Boeing, using technical and financial support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the company said.     The company said the engine has fuel savings of 40 to 70 pct over those used in aircraft used today.  Reuter &#3;
