SEARS <S> SALES REFLECT COMPETITIVE PRICING

Analysts who follow Sears, Roebuck and Co said the company's 4.2 pct sales gain in March by its Merchandise Group reflects more competitive pricing and continues a pattern of growth started in late 1986.     Sears said sales for the five weeks ended April 4 rose to 2.62 billion dlrs from 2.51 billion dlrs a year earlier.     Linda Kristiansen of Paine Webber Inc called the numbers "impressive," and said she looks for a full-year sales gain of five pct for the nation's largest retailer. reuter^M &#3;
