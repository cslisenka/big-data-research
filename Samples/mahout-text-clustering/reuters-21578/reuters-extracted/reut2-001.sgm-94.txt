ATT <T> SETS SOME PHONE EQUIPMENT DISCOUNTS

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said small businesses can win up to a 10 pct discount on telephone equipment under a new program.     According to the America's Choice Bonus Program, customers that rent certain phone systems can earn credits each time they pay their monthly or fixed term lease bills.     The credits can be used in the purchase of ATT products, including communications systems and the System 25 PBX, a telephone switch for voice and data communications. Customers will receive a 50 dlrs initial credit, and additions to their account equivalent to 10 pct of their rental payments.  Reuter &#3;
