MARKET FALL DISCUSSED AT REAGAN LUNCH

President Reagan and his advisers discussed the stock market fall at a previously scheduled "issues lunch" at the White House, officials said.     There was no formal comment on the market slide, but an official suggested that a comment might be forthcoming after the market closed.      Reagan made no mention of the stock market when he gave a glowing account of recent economic performance at the swearing in of C. William Verity as Commerce Secretary.     He said this month would set a record for the longest peacetime expansion on record and added that leading indicators had sent a message of "steady as she goes."      Reuter &#3;
