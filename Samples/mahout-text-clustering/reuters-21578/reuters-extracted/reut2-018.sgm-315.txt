BANK OF CANADA WELCOMES GREENSPAN APPOINTMENT

The Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, believes economist Alan Greenspan was a sound choice to replace retiring U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, a spokesman for the bank said.     "Mr. Greenspan is well known to the bank. He's had a lot of experience. He's very capable, and with Mr. Volcker's decision not to seek reappointment, he's a sound choice," said Roy Flett, associate secretary for the bank.     Flett said, "the Bank of Canada has enjoyed an excellent relationship with Mr. Volcker during his terms and has only the greatest respect for his performance."     Economists said the appointment was extremely important to Canada because the country's monetary policy is closely linked with that of the U.S.     "Basically, we have chosen ... to march in lockstep with U.S. monetary policy, so really in some sense this is our central banker that has just been appointed as well," said Mike McCracken, head of Infometrica Ltd.
