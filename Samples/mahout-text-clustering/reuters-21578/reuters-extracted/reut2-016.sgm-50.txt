TREASURY'S BAKER CALLS FOR MORE BANK FLEXIBILITY

Treasury Secretary James Baker said that commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in their concerted lending mechanisms "to help assure continued participation in new money packages."     He said that major debtor nations need to be able to count on receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential to support well-conceived economic programs.     His remarks were made to the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee.     Baker said, "The sense of urgency and willingness to cooperate in support of a larger general interest that helped to carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and 1983 is now less evident."     He said to address this problem, it is important for the commercial banks to "develop a menu of alternative new money  options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose in providing continuing support for debtor reforms."     He said the "continued implementation of the debt strategy may well rest on their doing so."     Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest income countries remain an issue of "critical concern to the United States."     He said that he intended to address the problem of poor country prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting of the joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee.     Baker said, however, that ministers should guard against what appear to be magical solutions to the complex debt problem.     "I want to stress the need for all to guard against the ephemeral attraction of magical solutions, which may appear as tantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grappling with our debt problems," he said.     But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is to approach each situation on a case-by-case basis, "bringing to bear the policies and financing needed to bring the economy back to sustained economic growth."
