KRUPP MANAGER ARRESTED FOR FRAUD IN W. GERMANY

A manager with steel producer Krupp Stahl AG <KRPG.F> was arrested yesterday for fraud and falsifying documents, the state prosecutor's office said today.     Two executives of steel trading companies in North Rhine Westphalia and Hanover were also arrested for aiding the Krupp manager, a spokesman for the office said. The office identified the manager only as Alex I.     He said the manager is charged with faking signatures on forms ordering large shipments of heavy steel plate from one of the trading companies for which Krupp AG paid.     The spokesman said the manager ordered the shipments, which on paper were for Krupp Stahl AG in Bochum but were delivered to the trade house near Hanover.     The three men are also accused of pocketing profits from the sale of the steel plates, but both Krupp and the prosecutor's office declined comment on how much money was involved.     The Hanover daily Hannoversche Allgemeine said in an article today the shipments' order value totalled 100 million marks, while another local daily, the Neue Presse, put the value at 50 million marks.
