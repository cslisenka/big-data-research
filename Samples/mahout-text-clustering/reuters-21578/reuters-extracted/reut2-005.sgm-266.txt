HUNGARIAN BANK DENIES MISCONDUCT IN VW AFFAIR

The National Bank of Hungary said its name had been used in fraudulent foreign exchange contracts with Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> but denied any misconduct on its part.     National Bank managing director Laszlo Karczag told Reuters, "All our businesses (with Volkswagen) had been closed with all payments made when due on both sides and therefore we do not have ... Any open or unsettled positions whatsoever with them."     Karczag said the bank was in contact with Volkswagen and was "rendering them all possible assistance in their investigations."     The West German weekly Der Speigel said a fraud involving VW's reported 480 mln mark loss on foreign exchange dealings came to light when the Hungarian National Bank refused to honour what turned out to be a fake forward currency purchase contract.     Reading a prepared statement, Korczag said, "We have knowledge, however, of the fact that in certain fraudulent contracts the name of the National Bank of Hungary has also been misused. We deny any kind of misconduct on our part."     The bank had been doing foreign exchange business with Volkswagen "for a few years," he said.  REUTER &#3;
