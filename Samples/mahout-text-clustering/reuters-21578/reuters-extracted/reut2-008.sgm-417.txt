MEDICAL GRAPHICS <MGCC> CHAIRMAN RESIGNS

Medical Graphics Corp said William Stubblefield resigned as chairman and chief executive officer, effective immediately, with President Kye Anderson assuming his duties.     It said Stubblefield's leadership abilities and personal integrity were "unquestioned," but because of "false rumors in the investment community" he felt he could no longer be effective as an officer.     Stubblefield quit as president of Endotronics Inc <ENDO> in October. On Friday, Endotronics reported that its auditor, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co, said it withdrew its approval of the company's financial data for the fiscal year ended Sept 30, 1986.     Endotronics also said it was cooperating with the Securities and Exchange Commission and acknowledged a grand jury investigation into its operations.     Medical Graphics said Stubblefield had made "significant contributions" to the company.  Reuter &#3;
