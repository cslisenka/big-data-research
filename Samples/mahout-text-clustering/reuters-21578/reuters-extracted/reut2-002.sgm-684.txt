DUFF/PHELPS DOWNGRADES USX CORP <X> DEBT

Duff and Phelps said it has downgraded fixed income securities of USX Corp and its subsidiaries and at the same time took the issues off its watch list.     The change affects about 6.6 billion dlrs in debt securities.     USX senior debt was lowered to DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9 middle BBB), Marathon oil senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9, United States Steel senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9 and subordinated debt to DP-13 (low BB) from DP-11, USX preferred stock to DP-14 (high B) from DP-12 (middle BB) and preference stock to DP-15 (middle B) from DP-13.     The downgrades reflect substantial business risk and increased financial risk, Duff and Phelps said.     The steel industry remains intensely competitive and major domestic integrated producers have lost share to imports and minimills, D and P said. In oil and gas, profitability and cash flows are larger, but there is still considerable volatility. As for financial risk, USX has arranged to borrow 1 billion dlrs through a production payment of its Marathon subsidiary. Consequently a selected group of creditors has prior claim to public debt holders for cash flows from this asset, D and P said.  Reuter &#3;
