COMPUTER SYSTEMS STRAINED BY MARKET COLLAPSE

The nation's exchanges and brokerage houses said their computers systems have been strained by the avalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock market collapse.     And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources have been able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in trading volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to revamp their computer systems and communications networks several years earlier than they had planned, industry officials said.     "We had already started certain processes to increase the New York Stock Exchange's capacity," said Jim Squyres, a spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, which runs the central computer network for the New York and American Stock Exchanges.     "We will have to seriously consider speeding that up," he said. After three straight days of record volume, however, many exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. And while the exchanges said their computers were handling the crush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades and delayed price quotes.     The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a record fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln shares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entire industry.     The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashed just 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific Stock Exchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catch up with a massive backlog of trades.     And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut off several times during the day, leaving some traders with quotes that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.      Although the computers whirred away late into the night, the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer, even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combined volume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchanges topped 900 mln shares.     "I think we're equipped for this kind of trading," said Paul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for the American Stock Exchange.     "The problem is less the computers, which are handling the volume, than the strain on people," he said.          "The computers might turn out to be the heroes of this whole thing," added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president of technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.     In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on trading was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors, the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.     But even as computer executives spoke with awe about their systems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, they started to plan for the future.       "We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this volume," said Squyres of the Securities Industry Automation Corp (SIAC), which is jointly owned by the New York and American Stock exchanges.     SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by up to 50 pct by 1990. But that and other improvements will now be made much earlier.     Meanwhile, New York Telephone Co said Monday's panic selling did not wreak havoc on its telephone system.     "It was a normally heavy business day," said company spokesman Steve Marcus.
