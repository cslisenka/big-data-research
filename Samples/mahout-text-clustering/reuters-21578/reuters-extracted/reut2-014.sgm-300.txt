CBT WHEAT FUTURES EASE TO MIXED BY MIDSESSION

CBT wheat futures closed from early contract highs in new crop to trade quietly mixed at midsession, ranging from up 3/4 cent per bushel in May to down 3/4 in new crop July.     After opening higher on follow-through speculative buying after yesterday's technically strong close, prices eased on trade-talk that some countries who were holding buying tenders this week have rejected U.S. offers or have taken wheat from other exporting countries, traders said.     However, the strong chart picture probably will limit declines, they added.     Cargill Grain was the featured seller in new crop July, sparking rumors that the U.S. is currently not competitive on the World wheat market, even with government programs.  Reuter &#3;
