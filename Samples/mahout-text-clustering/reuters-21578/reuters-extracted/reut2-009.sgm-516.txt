CASINO COMMISSION DELAYS VOTE ON HOLIDAY <HIA>

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission said it will put off for one week a decision on whether to approve a 2.4 billion dollar recapitalization plan previously announced by Holiday Corp <HIA>.     Holiday Corp is the licensee of Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.     A spokeswoman for the commission said the commissioners felt they needed more time to review testimony taken at an all-day meeting Monday.     A decision had been expected at the group's regular weekly meeting today but the vote is now due April one.     The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement last week completed a review of the Holiday recapitalization plan and listed 10 areas of concern.     The enforcement unit, which did not draw conclusions or make recommendations, said the Commission had to decide if the adoption of a leveraged financial structure will leave Holiday in a financially stable condition which is required by the New Jersey Casino control Act.
