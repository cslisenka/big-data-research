ANCHOR SAVINGS BANK OFFERING FULLY SUBSCRIBED

Anchor Savings Bank said its subscription offering was fully subscribed, precluding an underwritten public offering of Anchor stock.     The company, which will be traded on Nasdaq under the symbol <ABKR>, said final tabulation has not been completed.     The offering was made in connection with Anchor's conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank, it said.     The bank offered 15.3 mln shares of common stock at 8.50 dlrs to 11.50 dlrs a share, with the possible issuance of up to an additional 2,295,000 shares, it said.     The company said trading in the bank stock will not commence until all regulatory requirements have been completed.     Anchor said it had total assets of 7.3 billion dlrs as of June 30, 1986.     It said shares were offered to bank depositors, borrowers and through a direct mail campaign.  Reuter &#3;
