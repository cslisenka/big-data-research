JAPAN TO CURB VEHICLE EXPORTS TO EC

Japanese car makers will curb their exports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficial directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), automobile industry sources said.     Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to be at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and may even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic growth and increasing trade friction.     Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to exercise prudence in exporting to Europe.    Reuter &#3;
