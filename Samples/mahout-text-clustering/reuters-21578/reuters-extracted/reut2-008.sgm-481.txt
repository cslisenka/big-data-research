SICO SETS NAME CHANGE, REORGANIZATION

<Sico Inc> said it changed its name to Sico Group as part of an administrative reorganization to decentralize responsibilities based on the nature of the paint manufacturer's various markets.     The company said it formed a new subsidiary, Sico Industries Inc, based in Toronto, to regroup industrial operations across Canada and those of its own subsidiary Sterling Inc.     Sico formed another subsidiary, Sico Canada Inc, to distribute trade paint products across Canada, except in Quebec.     The company said its Sico Quebec Trade Division will be responsible for all Quebec activities of the company's trade paints division, whose products are now marketed under the Sico and Crown Diamond trademarks.     The Sico Group is the largest Canadian-owned paint and coatings manufacturer with Canada-wide product distribution, it said.  Reuter &#3;
