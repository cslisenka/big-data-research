U.K. SEEKS MORE GLOBAL SECURITIES CO-OPERATION

Britain intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources said.     The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japan's Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information.     The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds, but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges.     The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany and Holland.     Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K. Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September.     Today's agreement will deal with requests for information on a "case by case" basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is not legally binding and comes into force immediately.  REUTER &#3;
