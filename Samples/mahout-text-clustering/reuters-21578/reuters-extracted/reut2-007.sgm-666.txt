LISBON OFFICIAL SAYS "NO PROBLEMS" ON MACAO

A Portuguese official today said no more problems remained in settling the future of Macao, and China's Foreign Ministry said an "important announcement" would be made at the end of talks on the tiny territory.     A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, indicating the two countries were close to agreement on the handover of Macao to Peking, told journalists: "The talks are still in progress. When they end, there will be an important announcement."     Portuguese Ambassador to China Octavio Valerio said there would be no formal talks over the weekend, but chief Portuguese negotiator Rui Medina said earlier he would have contacts later today with his Chinese counterpart Zhou Nan. Valerio said the next formal talks would be Monday. "It will be the last one and we hope there will be a communique."  Reuter &#3;
