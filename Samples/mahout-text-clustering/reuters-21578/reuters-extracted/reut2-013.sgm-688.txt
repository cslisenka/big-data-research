OLIVETTI TO ANNOUNCE NEW COMPUTER LINE IN JUNE

Ing. C. Olivetti EC Spa <OLIV.MI> plans to announce a new line of computer products in June, company chairman Carlo De Benedetti said at a news conference.     De Benedetti said the new products would include personal computers and would compete with the new computers announced last week by International Business Machines Corp <IBM>.     De Benedetti reiterated that Olivetti's provisional figures show that 1986 turnover rose 1160 billion lire to 7,300 billion lire and that net profit will be more than 550 billion lire compared with 503.7 billion the year before.     "This year will be a year of consolidation of the results reached thus far and characterized by an important renewal of the product line and the turnaround of Triumph Adler," he said.     Olivetti acquired West German typewriter maker <Triumph Adler> from Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> last year . As part of the deal, VW bought a five pct stake in Olivetti. De Benedetti added that Olivetti would continue to seek international alliances.  Reuter &#3;
