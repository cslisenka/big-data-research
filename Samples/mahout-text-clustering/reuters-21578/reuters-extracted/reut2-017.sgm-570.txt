HOSPITAL CORP <HCA> GETS FINANCING COMMITMENTS

Hospital Corp of America said it received financing commitments of about 1.9 billion dlrs to pay for its previously announced reorganization.      Hospital Corp said under the reorganization, over 100 hospitals will be spun off to a new, independent company owned by an employee stock ownership plan, ESOP, for 1.8 billion dlrs in cash.     Hospital Corp said in addition to the cash payment, it will also receive preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 34 pct of the fully diluted stock of the new company.         According to Hospital Corp, the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of the year, and proceeds will be used to reduce Hospital Corp's debt and to repurchase Hospital Corp common shares.      Hospital Corp said the 100 hospitals to be acquired by the new company had net revenues totaling about 1.5 mln dlrs in 1986.     Hospital Corp further said the ESOP would initially own 99.5 pct of the outstanding common stock of the new company or about 51 pct on a fully diluted basis.         Hospital Corp said the new company's management would initially purchase one-half of one pct of the common stock of the new company, with incentive plans providing management the opportunity to earn up to 10 pct of the stock.     According to Hospital Corp, institutions purchasing debt of the new company will receive warrants for the remaining five pct of the new company's fully diluted common stock.     Hospital Corp said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc has agreed to provide bridge financing, or to find buyers for debt of the new company, for an amount of up to 956 mln dlrs.         The financing will comprise 270 mln dlrs of senior unsecured ESOP debt and 686 mln dlrs of unsecured subordinated financing for the new company, Hospital Corp said.     Additionally, Wells Fargo Bank NA has agreed to syndicate up to 940 mln dlrs of secured bank financing, comprising a 400 mln dlr revolving credit loan and a 540 mln dlr separate ESOP term loan, Hospital Corp said.     Wells Fargo has committed itself to fund an aggregate 400 mln dlrs of these loans, Hospital Corp said.     Hospital Corp said it will not guarantee any of the debt.  Reuter &#3;
