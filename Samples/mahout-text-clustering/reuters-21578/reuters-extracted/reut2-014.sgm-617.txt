YEUTTER CALLS TEXTILE BILL "PURE PROTECTIONISM"

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said a textile bill, widely expected to be offered as an amendment to trade legislation on the House or Senate floor, is "pure protectionism."     "Its attachment to a trade bill would kill the bipartisan, cooperative spirit needed to produce growth-oriented, market-opening legislation," he said in a speech prepared for the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.     President Reagan vetoed that bill last year and would almost certainly reject this year's bill, he added.     "We simply cannot accept legislation that would provoke retaliation against American exporters, destroy the Uruguay Round, and embroil us in dozens of trade wars," the trade representative said.
