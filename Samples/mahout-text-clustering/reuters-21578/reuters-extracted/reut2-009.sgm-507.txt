SAS TO UPGRADE CABIN SERVICE IN SCANDINAVIA

Scandinavian Airlines Systems, SAS, said it will improve cabin service for business class passengers on intra-Scandinavian routes starting next week.     The company also said it will simplify timetables on routes in Scandinavia, with many flights departing hourly.     SAS said it will upgrade meals and between meal refreshments and relegate the sale of tax-free candy and cosmetics to airport shops to give cabin attendants more time to devote to the enhanced service.
