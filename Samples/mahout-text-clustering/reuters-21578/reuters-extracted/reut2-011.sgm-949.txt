MILLER SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES U.S. EXCISE TAX HIKES

Office of Management and Budget director James Miller said President Reagan opposes increases in the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol to help reduce the federal budget deficit.     In an address before a group of House Republicans, Miller reiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. "I think also he would opose an increase in the gas tax."     He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed his opposition to a cigarette tax hike. "In the case of the cigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax is higher than now, and the same on wine and spirits."     Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a tax hike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the 1988 financial year.     House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommend an 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988 budget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left to the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.     Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenue increases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrak railroad, higher federal fees for services and larger individual payments for social programs.     "It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no tax increase," Miller said.     He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set a new tax on security transactions was "a nonstarter" with the White House. The tax would be a tax on capital which would discourage all but the most profitable short-term transactions and could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.     "Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any tax increase," Miller urged the Republicans.     Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for 1988.  Reuter &#3;
