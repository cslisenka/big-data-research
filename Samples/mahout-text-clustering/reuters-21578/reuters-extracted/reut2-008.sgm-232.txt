HEWLETT-PACKARD <HWP> BEGINS TEST SHIPMENTS

Hewlett-Packard Co said it began limited customer shipments of its HP 3000 Series 930 business computer and remains on schedule for first commercial shipments in mid-1987.     Shipments of the higher-performance series 950 business computers are scheduled for the second half of this year, it said.     In September, the company postponed initial shipments of the Series 930 computer until mid-1987 because performance of the operating software system was below target.  Reuter &#3;
