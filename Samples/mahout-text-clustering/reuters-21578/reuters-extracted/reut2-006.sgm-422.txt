WHEELING-PITTSBURGH <QWHX> CHIEF EXECUTIVE QUITS

Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp said George A. Ferris, 70, has resigned as vice chairman and chief executive officer.     The company also said Lloyd C. Lubensky, 64, its largest shareholder, has been named chairman.  Lubensky is president of Ryder System Inc's <RDR> American Jet Industries subsidiary.  In early January Allan E. Paulson sold his 34.2 pct stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh to Lubensky and resigned as chairman.  No successor was named at the time.  Ferris, Lubensky and director John P. Innes made up an executive committee formed last month to operate Wheeling-Pittsburgh.  Reuter &#3;
