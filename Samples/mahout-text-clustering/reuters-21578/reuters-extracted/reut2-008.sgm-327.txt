COSTAIN TO CHANGE NAME TO COSCAN DEVELOPMENT

<Costain Ltd>'s shareholders will be asked at the April 16 annual meeting to approve a change in the company's name to Coscan Development Ltd, the company said in the annual report.     Under terms of the 1984 sale of controlling interest in the company to <Carena-Bancorp Inc> from Costain Group Plc, the Costain name was to be changed.     Costain said a settlement was reached with the Costain Group concerning a legal action launched before shareholders at the 1986 annual meeting approved in principle changing the company's name to Costan. The Costan name was not implemented.     Costain also said in the annual report that it should report further growth in earnings due to increased level of activity in 1987 and expectation of improved margins.     It said it expects housing revenue will increase by 25 pct in 1987, supported by an increased number of active projects and a carry forward of 427 sales. Costain reported housing revenue in 1986 of 229.6 mln dlrs, up from 159.2 mln dlrs in 1985.     Costain previously reported 1986 earnings of 12.9 mln dlrs or 93 cts a share, compared to 6.9 mln dlrs or 63 cts a share in the prior year.  Reuter &#3;
