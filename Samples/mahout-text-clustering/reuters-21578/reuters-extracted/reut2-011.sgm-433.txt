LYPHOMED <LMED> FORMS NEW DIVISION

LyphoMed Inc said it is forming a new division, called IPHARM, to develop a full line of generic and proprietary ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.     Lyphomed said in its initial phase the division will produce products exclusively for the 200 mln dlr hospital use only market.     The company said that in its next phase IPHARM will extend its market to include both hospital and non-hospital customers which it estimates to be valued at 800 mln dlrs to 1 billion dlrs in total.     Ultimately, Lyphomed said IPHARM will concentrate on developing new proprietary ophthalmic dosage forms.     Lyphomed said the division has already submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications to the Food and Drug Administration and will submit several more within the next six months.     Lyphomed said the division will operate out of its Melrose Park manufacturing facility and will be headed by Ramesh Acharya, Lyphomed vice president and general manager.  Reuter &#3;
