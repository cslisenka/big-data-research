U.S. BUDGET DIRECTOR WARNS AGAINST TAX INCREASE

The director of the Office of Management and Budget James Miller warned that a tax increase would jeapordise real U.S. economic growth.     "It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance the budget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that would halt economic expansion," Miller told students at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.     "I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if we have a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving up on deficit reduction," he said.     Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright to put a one pct tax on securities transactions.     He said the tax would probably be ineffective because people would avoid by holding their portfolios in other instruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading as often.     Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.     "I think it is frankly all but political suicide to advocate a tax increase unless the president championed it as well," he said. "And he's not going to do it, in fact he would veto a tax increase," Miller added.  Reuter &#3;
