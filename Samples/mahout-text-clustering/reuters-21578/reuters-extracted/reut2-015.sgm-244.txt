NEW HAMPSHIRE YANKEE TO SUBMIT EMERGENCY PLANS

<New Hampshire Yankee> said it will submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission emergency response plans for the six Massachusetts communities within a 10-mile radius of the Seabrook Station.     New Hampshire Yankee, a consortium of utility companies, said it is filing the plans because it claimed Massachusetts refuses to cooperate with it in emergency planning.     It said the 26-volume emergency plan was originally prepared for Massachusetts by the state Civil Defense Agency and emergency planning consultants.     New Hampshire Yankee said submitting the plans was done in an effort to keep the Seabrook licensing process moving forward.  Reuter &#3;
