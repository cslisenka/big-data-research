<RANGE ROVER> TO SELL VEHICLES IN U.S.

Range Rover of North America Inc, a subsidiary of the British Land Rover Group, said it would begin selling the luxury utility vehicles in the United States March 16 at a suggested retail price of 30,825 dlrs.     Range Rover executives told Reuters after a press conference they expect to generate 80 mln dlrs in revenues this year, but that the U.S. venture is not expected to become profitable until 1989.     The executives said they expect to sell 3,000 of the vehicles this year from an initial network of 37 dealers, which will be gradually expanded to 65 within a year.     Range Rover's project, aimed at buyers with household incomes above 100,000 dlrs annually, is the culmination of a four-year effort by Land Rover Group to introduce the British-build vehicle in the U.S. market.     The executives said the only option to be offered with the vehicles will be a leather upholstery package priced at 1,025 dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
