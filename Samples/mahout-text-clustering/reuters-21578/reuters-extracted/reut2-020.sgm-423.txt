PHILADELPHIA HALTS MAJOR INDEX OPTION TRADE

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange said trading was halted about 1105 EDT in its value line composite index option that involves about 1,700 stocks.     The exchange added that its gold and silver options index did not open trading Tuesday, but that trading continued in its national over-the-counter stock index option.     The halt in the value line index option accompanied index option trading halts by other major U.S. exchanges.  Reuter &#3;
