CCC ADJUSTS PIK DIFFERENTIALS FOR GULF CORN

The Commodity Credit Corporation late Friday readjusted county price differentials for PIK corn redemptions traded off the Louisiana Gulf, according to a CCC spokesman at the Kansas City Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, office.     He said the adjusted differentials supersede the adjustments made March 30. They represent an increase over the original differentials but are lower than the differential adjustments recently made.     For differentials of five to 15 cents, CCC added one cent. For 16-25 cents add two cents, for 26-35 cts add three cts, for 36-45 cts add four cts and for 46-55 cts add five cts.     The recent drop in barge freight rates prompted the adjustments, the source said.  Reuter &#3;
