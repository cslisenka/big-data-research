EC AGREES ON AID PACKAGE FOR MEDITERRANEAN STATES

European Community (EC) foreign ministers have agreed on an aid package of loans and grants totalling more than 1.6 billion European Currency Units (Ecu) for states in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region.    The five-year accord increases aid to the states, Tunisia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria, by about 60 pct from the previous pact, Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans told a news conference. The EC's executive Commission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion Ecus, about 70 pct more than the last aid deal, but West Germany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct.     The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the EC, while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in loans from the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term investment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed will be worked out by EC officials.     Syria, while still officially included on the list, will not receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to it. The EC last year imposed sanctions against Syria because of its alleged role in the attempted bombing of an Israeli airliner.  REUTER &#3;
