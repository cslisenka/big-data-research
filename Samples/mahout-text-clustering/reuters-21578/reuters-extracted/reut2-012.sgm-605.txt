FREEPORT MCMORAN <FTX> DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed Freeport McMoRan Inc's 265 mln dlrs BB-minus subordinated debt. The implied senior debt rating is BB-plus.     S and P cited a decline in debt leverage to a pro forma 50 pct from 66 pct at year-end 1986.  Equity and gas and oil property sales reduced debt incurred in acquiring Petro-Lewis Corp, American Royalty Trust and Agrico Chemical Co.     The doubling of oil and gas reserves from a year earlier  and synergies between the firm's agricultural operations and Agrico strengthen its competitive position, but a rise in financial risk slows the improvement, S and P pointed out.
