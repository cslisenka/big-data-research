EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE IN NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND

Earthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.     Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).     No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said.     A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.     The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.  Reuter &#3;
