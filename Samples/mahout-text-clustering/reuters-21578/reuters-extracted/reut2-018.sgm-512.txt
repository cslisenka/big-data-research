NEW ZEALAND TO CLOSE TAX LOOPHOLES

Finance Minister Roger Douglas said New Zealand would enact legislation to prevent local companies and individuals from using overseas tax havens.     The government would also outlaw the practice of double deduction of losses by dual resident companies, known as "double dipping," Douglas said in a budget statement.     The anti-tax-haven legislation would affect non-resident entities, such as companies and trusts, set up in low tax countries and earning mainly passive investment income, Douglas said.     A consultative document will be released in September explaining the proposed legislation, and a consultative committee will then receive public submissions and advise the government on implementation, Douglas said.     The legislation would attack tax avoidance but not genuine business activity, he added.     He said some New Zealand residents were avoiding New Zealand tax entirely by setting up non-resident entities in tax havens, which intercepted and gathered income taxable in New Zealand.     In a move to counter "double dipping," the government would no longer allow dual resident companies to group their losses, Douglas said.     The proposed legislation would require them to carry tax losses forward to be offset against future profits, effective for income years starting after December 17, 1986.  REUTER &#3;
