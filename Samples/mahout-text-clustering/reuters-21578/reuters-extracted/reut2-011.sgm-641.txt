LUCKY <LKS> SPINOFF GETS FAVORABLE TAX RULING

Lucky Stores Inc said its planned distribution of Hancock Fabrics shares to Lucky stockholders will qualify as a tax-free spinoff under the Internal Revenue Code.     The company also said it still must wait for completion of a pending Securities and Exchange Commission review of an information statement related to the spinoff before it can carry out the transaction.     Subject to completion of the review, it expects to make the distribution in early May, Lucky Stores also said.  Reuter &#3;
