FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY PLEADS GUILTY TO TAX EVASION

Former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Anderson, whom Dwight Eisenhower once said deserved to be president, pleaded guilty to income tax evason charges and illegally running an offshore bank.     Anderson, declaring that he was "deeply regretful," admitted to evading tax on 127,500 dlrs in undeclared income.   Much of the money was paid to him for lobbying for controversial South Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.     The 77-year-old Anderson was President Eisenhower's treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 and a prominent businessman afterwards. In his memoirs, Eisenhower said Anderson deserved to be president.     Standing before Federal Court Judge Edmund Palmieri, Anderson, who faces up to 10 years in jail, said he had recently undergone two operations and treatment for alcoholism.     The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that Anderson be sent to jail.     According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the British West Indies for two years ending in 1985.     During that time, government prosecutors said the bank conducted operations in New York city but failed to register with state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have lost at least 4 mln dlrs.     Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but admitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and faces civil fines for both years.     Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983 from a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification Church. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan repayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been reported as income.  Reuter &#3;
