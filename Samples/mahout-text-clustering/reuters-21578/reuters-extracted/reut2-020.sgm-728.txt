MERRILL <MER> CHAIRMAN AND CFO ARE OPTIMISTIC

In a joint statement, Merrill Lynch and Co Inc chairman and chief executive William Schreyer and chief operating officer Daniel tully said that despite the unprecedented stock market decline, they are confident that an upturn lies ahead.     "In the view of our market experts, yesterday's unprecedented stock market decline was an over-reaction to fears of higher interest rates, more inflation and a lower dollar. Indeed, after examining many factors, there is reason to believe than an upturn lies ahead," the statement said.     The Merrill Lynch executives also said in the statement that the fact that bonds rallied, commodities weakened and the dollar remained relatively firm suggests that the central banks may now act to provide the system with additional liquidity.     "While further carry-over selling from yesterday and worries about a stock decline in Japan may put further pressure on the market in the near-term, we believe that this central bank cooperation would provide the fuel for a recovery in stock prices and a revival of confidence relecting fundamental values," the statement said.
