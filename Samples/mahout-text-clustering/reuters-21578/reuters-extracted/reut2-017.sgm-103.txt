HYUNDAI AUTO CANADA TO RECALL 126,524 CARS

Hyundai Auto Canada Inc, wholly owned by the South Korean concern, said it recalled 126,524 cars for inspection of a mechanism that may cause the hood to open without warning while the vehicle is in motion.     The company said the voluntary recall affects Hyundai Pony cars sold in Canada and produced before Dec 4, 1986.     Hyundai models sold in the United States and other countries are not affected by the recall.  Reuter &#3;
