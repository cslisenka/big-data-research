BLAST ROCKS U.S. MILITARY BUILDING IN MANILA

An explosion rocked a building at the U.S. military office in Manila but there were no immediate reports of casualties, a police spokesman said tonight.     He said investigators were still looking into the explosion inside the motor pool building of the Joint United States Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG) in a Manila suburb.     Home-made bombs were thrown into the JUSMAG compound last July causing minor damage.  Reuter &#3;
