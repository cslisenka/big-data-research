MELLON <MEL> SAYS SUIT IS WITHOUT MERIT

Mellon Bank Corp said that an earlier announced shareholder class action suit was totally without merit and that it would vigorously defend it.     Earlier, an attorney for shareholder John Paul Decker said he filed suit due to the precipitous decline in Mellon's stock since reporting on Thursday that it would be posting a first quarter loss of 55-65 mln dlrs.     Mellon's stock fell 3-5/8 to 40-3/4 today after plunging 6-1/4 yesterday. The shareholder's attorney said he charges that Mellon failed to disclose its true financial condition between February 1, 1985 and April 2, 1987.  Reuter &#3;
