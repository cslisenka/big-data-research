DAYTON HUDSON <XXX> DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it downgraded Dayton Hudson Corp's 1.3 billion dlrs of debt.     The agency cut to Aa-3 from Aa-2 Dayton Hudson's senior notes, debentures, revenue bonds and Eurodebt, and shelf registration to Provisional Aa-3 from Provisional Aa-2.     Moody's said it expected that leverage, which has risen because of an aggressive expansion program, would remain high due to the company's spending plans. The agency noted that Dayton Hudson's operating returns recently declined.     But Moody's also said the company's recent operating problems would probably be temporary.  Reuter &#3;
