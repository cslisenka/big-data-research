ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE <ABEV> DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it cut to Caa from B-2 Allegheny Beverage Corp's 112 mln dlrs of subordinated debt.     The rating agency cited Allegheny's high leverage and poor operating performance, as well as reduced cash flow.     Moody's said the company's prospects for improvement are limited by increasing competition in the food service industry and decreasing demand for the vending services that Allegheny provides. Moody's also said a renegotiated bank agreement includes accelerated amortization requirements that exacerbate Allegheny's already weakened ability to service its debt.  Reuter &#3;
