FRENCH FARMERS STRONGLY CRITICISE EC MILK PACT

The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible situation, French farm unions said.     The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm union, the FNSEA, said.     The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.     But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.     "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to Rouen.     FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals, rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.     The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports. Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in milk output.  Reuter &#3;
