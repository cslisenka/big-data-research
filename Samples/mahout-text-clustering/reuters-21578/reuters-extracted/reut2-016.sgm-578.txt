DONALDSON LUFKIN JENRETTE SUED BY SWISS FIRM

<Associated Metals and Minerals Corp> said its Swiss subsidiary, <Metall und Rohstoff AG>, sued <Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Inc>, the New York investment bank, for 65 mln dlrs.     The amount reflects the unsatisfied portion of a judgment issued in February by a London court against ACLI Metals (London) Ltd, a unit of DLJ, the company said.     A London Commercial court found that a DLJ managing director and ACLI employees fraudulently misappropriated Metal und Rohstoff collateral in 1983 to cover deficits in aluminum trading accounts, it said.     The court awarded 76 mln dlrs plus costs to Metall und Rohstoff, which received about 10 mln dlrs from ACLI.     The new lawsuit alleges that DLJ management misappropriated collateral and also charges it with breach of trust and abuse of the legal process.     In addition, Metall und Rohstoff has filed a petition in London seeking the compulsory involuntary bankruptcy of ACLI London. It is expected that a liquidator will be named shortly, Associated said.     DLJ is owned by <Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.>  Reuter &#3;
