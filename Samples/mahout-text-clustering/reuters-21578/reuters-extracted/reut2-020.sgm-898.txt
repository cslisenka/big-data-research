JAPANESE STOCKS WILL FALL, BUT NOT LIKE WALL ST

The massive stock market correction on Wall Street will force a decline in Japanese share prices but a decline of similar proportions will not occur due to economic factors, said Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of the board of Nomura Securities Co Ltd.     "There are less inflation worries in Japan and less possibility of interest rate rises," Tabuchi told reporters.     He also said Japan had a higher savings rate which provided more funds for investment than was the case in other countries.     "If interest rates rise worldwide, Japan may raise the discount rate, but the possibility of a Japanese rate increase is smaller than in the U.S., Britain and West Germany," Tabuchi said.     However, he noted that the Nikkei Dow stock index of the Tokyo stock exchange and the Dow Jones Industrial average have moved in tandem in the past four years.     The Dow fell 508 points to 1738 on Monday, its largest percentage decline since the First World War.     The Tokyo index fell 620.18 to 25,746.56 on Monday, the sixth largest decline on record.
