N.ZEALAND BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN AT 2.45 BILLION DLRS

New Zealand's budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87 ending March 31 is expected to be around the budget forecast of 2.45 billion N.Z. Dlrs but below a December forecast of 2.91 billion, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.     The 1985/86 budget deficit was 1.87 billion dlrs.     "It is clear now that the March tax flow has been considerably stronger than expected in some areas, particularly provisional and terminal tax..," Douglas said in a statement.     Overall tax revenue is now expected to be around 600 mln dlrs above forecast, though there is some uncertainty about revenue from the final goods and services tax and March income tax payments, he added.     "Net expenditure also appears to be tracking to end-of-year forecast with the expectation that over-expenditure in some areas will be offset by under-expenditure in others," he added.  REUTER &#3;
