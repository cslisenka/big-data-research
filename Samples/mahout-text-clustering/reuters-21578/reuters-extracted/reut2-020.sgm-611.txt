ALEX BROWN REFOCUSING CORPORATE SYNDICATE DESK

Alex Brown and Sons Inc said it is refocusing its corporate syndicate desk away from underwriting straight corporate debt issues to emerging company debt and collateralized mortgage obligations.     Marc Schneebaum, director of financial management with Alex Brown, said the stock market's downturn did not prompt the decision.     "Actually, this is one of those ironies in timing. This (refocusing) had been discussed for some time," he said.     Alex Brown, based in Baltimore, is one of the larger regional securities firms.  Reuter &#3;
