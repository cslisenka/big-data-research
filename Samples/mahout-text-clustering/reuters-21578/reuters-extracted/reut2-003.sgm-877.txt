BANK OF ITALY SETS MERCHANT BANK CAPITAL MINIMUM

A Bank of Italy circular that gives the green light for Italian banks to establish merchant banking units stipulates that such units must have a minimum capital of 50 billion lire.     The circular, which renders operative a previously detailed resolution agreed by a government interministerial committee last month, will open the door for wider participation by Italian banks in merchant banking activities.     Previously, such activities were essentially confined to state banks operating special credit sections to provide medium- and long-term loans to industry.     The circular also stipulates that merchant banks set up by banks can have debts totaling a maximum of double their capital.     It also stipulates that the total amount of risk capital that a merchant bank can hold in its portfolio must not exceed the value of the bank's own combined capital and reserves.     No investment in any single company must exceed 20 pct of the combined value of the merchant bank's capital and reserves.     The merchant banks may not acquire, either directly or indirectly, controlling stakes in companies in which they invest.  Reuter &#3;
