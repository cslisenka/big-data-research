FED'S JOHNSON SEES RISKS IN DEBT LOAD GROWTH

Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the rapid recent growth in corporate and household debt burdens posed risks to the economy but should be kept in perspective.     The heavy debt load "is one of our major concerns ... the risks are significant," he said in response to questions from the Eastern Economic Association, an academic group.     However, he added, the recent bull market on Wall Street had also made corporate equity levels soar, keeping corporate debt to equity ratios about constant.     Similarly, he said household net worth has increased at a faster pace than household debt "so that household debt-to-asset ratios have once again gone down."     Nonetheless, "I think that it's something to watch carefully, and obviously it's something we do," he said.  Reuter &#3;
