BANGLADESH TO SEEK WORLD BANK HELP FOR INDUSTRY

Bangladesh will seek additional money from the World Bank to finance industrial development which is facing a capital shortage and a lack of expertise, Finance Ministry officials said.     They said the government had revised downward its Annual Development Programme budget for this fiscal year by seven pct to 44.4 billion Taka.     A team will visit Washington next month for talks with World Bank executives and to ask for 200 mln dlrs from the bank's Industrial Programme Credit scheme, they said.     The new money would be in addition to nearly two billion dlrs aid which the World Bank, other leading agencies and donor countries are expected to offer Bangladesh for the year from July at their Paris meeting next month. They offered 1.85 billion dlrs to the country in 1986/87.     The Annual Development Programme budget has been cut mainly because of poor tax collection and a fall in public and private sector industrial investment, the Finance Ministry officials said. They said they expect a two pct growth in the industrial sector this year, against a target of five pct and a growth of 1.5 pct in 1985. They gave no further details.  REUTER &#3;
