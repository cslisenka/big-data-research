WARNER COMMUNICATIONS <WCI> UPGRADED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it upgraded 924 mln dlrs of debt of Warner Communications Inc.     Raised to Baa-1 from Ba-1 were the company's subordinated debt and Series A convertible exchangeable preferred stock. Moody's also affirmed Warner's Prime-2 commercial paper.     The agency cited substantial improvements in Warner's operating performance, a stronger balance sheet and favorable long-term prospects for its core business.     Warner's increased earnings and selective asset sales significantly reduced leverage and strengthened its equity base, Moody's said. Fixed-charge coverages have also improved.  Reuter &#3;
