TOP U.S. OFFICIAL SEES DELAY IN BANK REFORM

A top Treasury official said he does not expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S. banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election due to political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insider trading scandal on Wall Street.     George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a Wall Street Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going to happen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote on controversial issues in election years."     "It may take a while in the next administration ... to get something done," he added.     Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry, which would probably feature wider investment banking powers for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.     "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... these groups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policy terms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it is to get it going."     He also described current concern about insider trading as "a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpful backdrop to accomplish financial reform."     Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S. League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that the Reagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watered down.     Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years, compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs over three years.     Gould ruled out any new government initiative on banking reform but said that some broad guidelines to address these issues would be made public over the next few months.  Reuter &#3;
