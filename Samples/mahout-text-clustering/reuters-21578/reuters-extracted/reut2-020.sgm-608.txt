C AND D COMMODITIES DENIES FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

C and D Commodities, a major Chicago-based commodities firm, is not having any financial problems but has pulled out of the U.S. energy futures market because of excessive volatility, according to Dale Dellutri, executive consultant.     "We are not in any kind of financial problem at all but we will be out of the market because of the volatility," Dellutri said. "Individuals and customers are getting out," he added.  Reuter &#3;
