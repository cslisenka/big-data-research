FRANCE, BONN REACH ACCORD ON HELICOPTER DESIGN

France and West Germany have reached broad agreement on design specifications for a joint combat helicopter for the 1990s, the French Defence Ministry said.     A ministry spokesman said French Defence Minister Andre Giraud and his West German counterpart Manfred Woerner had "agreed in principle" on a common concept for the helicopter during talks in Bonn on Friday.     A joint commission will now be formed to work with firms involved in project and present a final report by July, he added.     The project, first drafted in 1984, calls for the French company <Aerospatiale> and <Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm> of Munich to develop and build 400 helicopters for the French and West German armed forces.     Its development, seen as a test of Europe's ability to collaborate on arms projects, has been dogged by different views on what type of helicopter to build and how to equip it.  REUTER &#3;
