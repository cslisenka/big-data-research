MAY DEPT STORES <MA> SEES RECORD FISCAL 1988

May Department Stores Co said it expects record profits and sales in the fiscal 1988 and also set a five-year 3.3 billion dlr capital expenditure plan.     "Our sights are set on achieving our 13th consecutive year of record sales and earnings," chairman David Farrell told the annual meeting.     In the year ended January 31, 1987, the company earned 381 mln dlrs or 2.44 dlrs a share on sales of 10.3 billion dlrs.     Farrell also said he expects improved second-quarter profits. "We believe second-quarter performance should show improvement over 1986," he said. In the quarter ended August 30, 1986, the company earned 45.6 mln dlrs or 52 cts on sales of 1.23 billion dlrs.      The five-year capital expenditure program includes 1.9 billion dlrs to open a record 73 department stores, 52 discount stores and about 1,200 specialty stores.     About two-thirds of the department stores will be opened by Lord and Taylor, May Co, and J.W. Robinson's in California, Hecht's in Washington, D.C., and G. Fox in Connecticut.     The remainder of the 3.3 billion dlrs will be used for store relocations, closings and remodelings, Farrell said.     Sales per square foot rose eight pct in 1986 to 134 dlrs, president Thomas Hays said, noting that the company seeks annual increases of 10 pct.     Also at the annual meeting, shareholders voted to approve indemnification of the company's officers and directors.  Reuter &#3;
