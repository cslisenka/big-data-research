CANADA'S WILSON SETS NEW PREFERRED SHARE TAX

Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled a ways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of corporate tax revenue.     Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financial tax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued after June 18 will be taxable.     The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two forms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, and one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.     "Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to fund personal income tax reductions," Wilson explained.     The minister said many profitable corporations, using various deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes, although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their profits.  Reuter &#3;
