DOME <DMP> SHAREHOLDER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT

Dome Petroleum Ltd said one of its common shareholders filed a class action suit in a New York court alleging the company, its chairman and president breached their fiduciary duties concerning Amoco Corp's proposed takeover of Dome.     Dome said the suit, filed by counsel representing Allen B. DeYoung, who holds 100 Dome common shares, names Dome, chairman J. Howard Macdonald, president John Beddome as defendents, as well as Amoco and Amoco's Canadian unit Amoco Canada Petroleum Co Ltd.     Dome said the class action suit, filed in United States district court in New York, seeks a court order declaring the Dome-Amoco takeover null and void or compensation in excess of 100 mln dlrs in actual damages, plus compensation for any consequential damages.     The suit also seeks to block a provision in the merger agreement for Dome to sell to Amoco its Primrose, Alberta, heavy oil properties for 79 mln dlrs if the takeover is not completed.  Reuter &#3;
