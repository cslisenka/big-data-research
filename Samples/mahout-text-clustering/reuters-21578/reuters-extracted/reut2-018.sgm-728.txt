MICROELECTRONICS TO RESTRUCTURE PROGRAM

<Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp> said its board approved a restructuring of its advanced computer architecture program.

The study occurred due to changing requirements, the company said.     Formerly comprised of four separate projects, the program will now have a central resaerch core and three laboratories called satellites. The work in the core program will focus on long-range research, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
