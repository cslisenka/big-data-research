FIRESTONE <FIR> IN AGREEMENT WITH CHAIRMAN

Firestone Tire and Rubber Co said Chairman John Nevin entered into a new employment agreement allowing him to continue as an executive or consultant with the company until he becomes 65 years old in February 1992.     Firestone said Nevin has agreed to remain as chief executive officer until its board elects a successor. The company was not immediately available for comment.    In the release, Firestone said while Nevin serves as chief executive, he will be paid his current salary and will continue to be eligible for supplemental compensation.     Firestone said Nevin will serve as a consultant to the company after a new chief executive is found and until Nevin becomes 65. Firestone said it agreed that during this period, Nevin will be paid a fee not less than the pension which he would have been entitled to if he retired.     It also said Nevin agreed not to engage in a competitive business until he becomes 67.     On February 17, Firestone granted Nevin an option to buy 100,000 shares of the company's common at 34.19 dlrs a share.  Reuter &#3;
