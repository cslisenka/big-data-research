U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT 35.74 BILLION DLRS IN MAY

The U.S. budget was in deficit 35.74 billion dlrs in May, compared with a deficit of 39.40 billion dlrs in May 1986, the Treasury Department said.     Last month's deficit followed an April surplus of 38.66 billion dlrs. For the fiscal year to date, the budget was in deficit 119.02 billion dlrs compared with a deficit of 165.81 billion dlrs in the previous fiscal year.     Outlays last month were 83.44 billion dlrs, down from 85.64 billion dlrs in May a year ago and 84.24 billion dlrs in April, the department said.     Receipts were 47.69 billion dlrs in May, up from 46.25 billion dlrs in May a year ago but down from 122.90 billion dlrs in April, the Treasury said.     The bulge in receipts in April which resulted in the surplus that month was the result of 1986 income tax payments by individuals.  Reuter &#3;
