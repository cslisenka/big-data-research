GILLETTE <GS> PAPER MAY BE CUT BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it placed on creditwatch with negative implications Gillette Co's A-2 commercial paper pending the outcome of a possible takeover by Revlon Group Inc <REV>.     Revlon, currently bound by a standstill agreement following an earlier bid for the company, has asked Gillette's board for permission to make a 40.50 dlr per share bid for the firm.     Should Revlon be successful, Gillette's rating would reflect the weaker credit quality and aggressive nature of Revlon, whose senior debt is rated B, the agency said.  Reuter &#3;
