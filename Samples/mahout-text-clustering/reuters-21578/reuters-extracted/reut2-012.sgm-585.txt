FLORIDA INVESTMENT FIRM SHUT BY SEC

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had Elliott Enterprises, an investment firm in Naples, Fla., shut down, accusing it of defrauding investors and misusing funds.     An SEC spokesman in Miami said the agency closed the investment holding company and two related firms, Elliott Securities and Elliott Mortgage Co.     In a complaint filed in federal court in Miami, the SEC said the firms had at least 1,000 customers who invested around 50 mln dlrs.     U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered the company closed, appointed a receiver and froze the assets of the firm's executives.  Reuter &#3;
