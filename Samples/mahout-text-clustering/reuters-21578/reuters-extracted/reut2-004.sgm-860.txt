WESTINGHOUSE <WX> TO DESIGN BRITISH NUCLEAR UNIT

Westinghouse Electric Corp said it will perform work valued in excess of 200 mln dlrs on the 1150-megawatt Sizewell B commercial nuclear power station which the United Kingdom will build near Suffolk on its southeast coast.     Westinghouse said it will design and erect the primary reactor coolant system, manufacture components and transfer technology for the power plant which the U.K. government announced plans for yesterday.     Westinghouse said its technology for the design of the pressurized water reactor will be transferred through its licensee in the United Kingdom, <National Nuclear Corp>.     The company said Britian's national utility, the Central Electricity Generating Board, has announced plans to apply for planning consent for a second pressurized water reactor, Hinkley C in Somerset, before the end of 1987.     The board has said it would like to build up to five pressurized water reactors before the end of the century, Westinghouse added.  Reuter &#3;
