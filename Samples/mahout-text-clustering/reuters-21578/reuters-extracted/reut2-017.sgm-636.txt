INT'L MINERALS <IGL> BIOTECH PRODUCT GETS NOD

International Minerals and Chemical Corp said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted permission to its subsidiary, IMCERA Bioproducts Inc, to make a genetically engineered microorganism for use as a growth factor in laboratories.     The action marks the first time such a biotechnological product has undergone successful review by the EPA, it said.     The EPA action clears the way for IMCERA to begin commercial production of the microorganism, Escherichia Coli K-12, in the production of its IGF-I growth factor for use in laboratories in cultivating tissues and cells, it said.     Escherichia Coli K-12 is a non-pathogenic organism commonly used in laboratory operations for studies and commercial fermentations, and does not affect humans, it said.     International Minerals said it plans to manufacture the microorganism at IMCERA's plant in Terre-Haute, Indiana and market it to research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and other countries.
