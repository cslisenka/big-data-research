E-TRON CORP REACHES AGREEMENT WITH FORMER PRES

E-tron Corp said it will submit a settlement agreement reached with its former president to the bankruptcy court for approval.     It said the settlement stems from a suit against the former company president.     E-tron, which is in Chapter 11, said the settlement calls for Irwin Lampert to return 2,350,000 shares of E-tron stock to its treasury, and prohibits Lampert from starting a business competive with E-tron, the company said.     It added Irwin must repay certain debts, also.     E-tron said it will submit soon a creditor proposal plan to get out of Chapter 11.  Reuter &#3;
