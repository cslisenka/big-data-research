ARGENTINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY

Financing talks here between the Argentine government and its bank advisory committee are finely poised, with the two sides still separated on the critical question of interest-rate spreads, bankers said.     Argentina is pressing for a margin of 13/16 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the same rate as on Mexico's recent new-loan and rescheduling package, but the banks are refusing, they said.     Negotiations continued in New York today, even though Finance Secretary Mario Brodersohn has returned to Argentina to consult president Raul Alfonsin on the proposed terms.     After the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan, bankers feel that they could not sell a package for Argentina with a margin of 13/16 pct. They are holding out for a spread close to one pct, with 7/8 pct - the rate won by Venezuela and the Philippines - as their rock-bottom offer.     "What they're looking at and what we've got on the table are not that far apart," one banker said.     Bankers said that Argentina is seeking to stretch out principal repayments on upcoming public-sector debt maturities for 19 years and is looking for a 13-year loan from the banks to cover the bulk of its 2.15 billion dlr new-money need.
