BRAZIL GOVERNORS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF FUNARO

Brazil's political crisis appears to be deepening as powerful state governors are calling for the removal of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of economic policy.     Commentators said their call, front-page headlines in today's press, laid bare President Jose Sarney's political weakness and highlighted Brazil's economic planning turmoil.     The demand for Funaro's resignation came last night from four governors with much combined political clout, those of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. At a news conference in Sao Paulo, they delivered a blunt message -- the economy was in crisis and they wanted a new ministerial team to shape policy. Otherwise there was a risk of social chaos.
