NEGOTIATIONS RESUME IN CANADIAN POSTAL STRIKE

Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-old strike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violence subsided after the federal government changed its mind and appointed a mediator.     The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Union of Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first since Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of a mediator yesterday.         There had been little progress between the parties last week and both sides requested a mediator for the second time. Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart to warrant the help on an independent third party.     Although the postal union said it would maintain its strategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, only the Montreal area was affected today and service was normal elsewhere in Canada.         Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use of replacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator was appointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.     Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160 million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand in the talks and the two sides remain far apart on wages and working conditions.
