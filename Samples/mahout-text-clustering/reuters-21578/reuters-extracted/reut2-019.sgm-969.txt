FED APPROVES INSURANCE ROLE FOR SOVRAN <SOVN>

The Federal Reserve Board said it approved Sovran Financial Corp's application to retain shares in Sovran Insurance Corp of Bethesda, Md.     Sovran controls banks in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia and last year acquired Suburban Bancorp which controlled an insurance subsidiary.     Insurance industry trade groups objected to Sovran's application, but the Fed ruled that Sovran was entitled to retain indirect control over Sovran Insurance under special grandfather exemptions to the prohibition against banks engaging in insurance under the Garn-St Germain bank law.
