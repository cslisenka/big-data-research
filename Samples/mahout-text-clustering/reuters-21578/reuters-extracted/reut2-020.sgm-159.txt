SHEARSON <SHE> NOT HURT BY RECENT MARKET DECLINE

Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said the recent decline in equities has had a dislocating effect on the market but no impact on the company's financial condition.     The company reported a drop in third quarter profits to 51 mln dlrs from 65 mln dlrs on increased revenues of 1.3 billion dlrs compared to 1.1 billion a year earlier.     "While the decline in equities in recent weeks has had a dislocating effect on the market in general," Chairman Peter A. Cohen said, "it has not had an impact on our financial condition."         Cohen said Shearson's third quarter earnings reflected the diversity of its revenues and "progress in several core businesses resulting in higher commission, investment banking and investment advisory revenues. These improvements were offset by a decline in revenues from market making and principle transactions and an increase in expenses from year ago levels," it said.      Reuter &#3;
