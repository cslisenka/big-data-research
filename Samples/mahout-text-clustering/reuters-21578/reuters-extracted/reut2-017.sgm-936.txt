HOECHST SALES FALL IN FIRST FIVE MONTHS

Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> parent company turnover fell in the first five months of 1987, with domestic business losing seven pct and exports dropping eight pct from the same period last year, management board chairman Wolfgang Hilger told the annual meeting.     In volume terms, however, turnover was somewhat improved, he said. Domestic sales, by volume, were steady in the first five months and export volume rose two pct.     He gave no figures for turnover or sales volume.     As already reported, parent company sales fell to 3.44 billion marks in the first quarter of 1987, 7.6 pct below the first 1986 quarter. Domestic sales lost 6.6 pct and export business fell by 8.5 pct compared with the 1986 quarter. First quarter group pre-tax profits rose to 686 mln marks from 649 mln in the same period last year.     Hilger said Hoechst's aim this year was to make prices competitive internationally, but also to cover costs. The compmany has already taken measures to reduce costs internally, he said. Hoechst expects to post another good profit in 1987, Hilger said.  REUTER &#3;
