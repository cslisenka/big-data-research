That is 46 basis points more than the yield of comparable Treasury securities.     Non-callable for life, the issue is rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's. Late last week, Moody's and S and P downgraded the telephone company's debt ratings, underwriters noted.  Reuter &#3;
