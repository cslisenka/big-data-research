MINNTECH <MNTX> GETS MORE CASH FOR DEVELOPMENT

Minntech Corp, a medical device manufacturer, said it has received an additional 175,000 dlrs from C.R. Bard <BCR> to develop and market an advanced membrane oxygenator for use in open heart surgery.     Minntech said Bard paid it the money on top of the 825,000 dlrs in non-refundable contract revenues Bard already paid as part of a development agreement. The company said it received the money after it delivered oxygenator units for animal testing to the Utah Biological Testing Laboratories.     Minntech also said it will receive additional milestone payments as the project development progresses, adding that Bard has agreed to buy some oxygenators following project completion and Food and Drug Administration approval.     Minntech President Louis Cosentino said the animal testing was successful and the company can now file for FDA approval and equip its oxygenator manufacturing facility.  Reuter &#3;
