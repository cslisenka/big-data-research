NATIONAL BANKING POSSIBLE BY 1991, HELLER SAYS

Federal Reserve Governor Robert Heller said that there should be something approaching full nationwide banking in the U.S. by 1990 or 1991.     While much of the basic reform in anachronistic interstate banking laws may come on the state level, he told a financial analysts' meeting here that he also hoped for some concrete action on a federal level to address geographic and other issues.     "A crisis will bring it about very quickly...but that is not the way I would like to see it happen," he said, adding, "there needs to be continued pressure on Congress (to act)."     Heller said that it is very difficult to visualize the final version of plans to reform the U.S. financial services industry, which are currently being discussed on Capitol Hill. "In the conference committee, anything can happen," he said.     He said that he hoped that his personal vision of banking reform, which he outlined earlier in a formal speech, would serve as a blueprint for Congressional debate.     In his speech, Heller called for a broad restructuing of the domestic financial services industry, which would allow commercial banks to diversify along wider geographic and product lines.
