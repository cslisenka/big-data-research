SOUTHDOWN <SDW> DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's said it lowered its rating of Southdown Inc's 50 mln dlrs of sinking fund debentures to BB-plus from BBB and removed the issue from Creditwatch.     The downgrading reflects higher debt levels from the debt-financed repurchase of 89 mln dlrs worth of common shares, combined with a bleaker earnings outlook due to weakness in key energy and Southwest cement markets.
