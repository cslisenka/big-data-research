REPUBLICBANK <RPT> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded RepublicBank Corp's 550 mln dlrs of debt.     Cut were the firm's senior debt to BBB-plus from A, subordinated debt to BBB from A-minus and preferred stock to BB-plus from BBB. Its A-2 commercial paper was maintained.     S and P said the action reflected a heightened risk profile for RepublicBank because of its proposed acquisition of InterFirst Corp <IFC>. However, the agency pointed out that the merger is a unique opportunity for RepublicBank to expand its already strong market position. InterFirst will remain on creditwatch until the transaction is closed, S and P said.  Reuter &#3;
