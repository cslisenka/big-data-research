AUSTRALIAN UNIONS PLAN NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES

Unions are planning a week of state-wide strikes in New South Wales, starting midnight next Tuesday, to protest against a state move to cut workers' compensation.     NSW Labour Council secretary John MacBean, who is also an executive member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), said the council has authorised the strikes and other industrial action.     The NSW government has introduced in the state parliament a new Workers' Compensation Act which would cut by up to one third the cash benefits paid to injured workers.     MacBean said almost every business sector would be hit and the unions would extend their action for two or three more weeks if the state government went ahead with its plan.  Reuter &#3;
