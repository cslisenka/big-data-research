CUMMINS <CUM>RECALLS WORKERS ON SIGNS OF UPTURN

Cummins Engine Co said it will temporarily recall about 150 production workers at its Columbus-area plants because it sees a moderate upturn in North American demand for heavy-duty truck engines.     The company said the recalls will begin March 30.     Production rates for Cummins' heavy-duty truck engines have increased about 10 pct over fourth-quarter levels and should stay at these levels through the first half of 1987, Cummins said.     The company also reported some upswing in demand for its components and service parts.  Reuter &#3;
