ECUADOREAN UNIONS TO CALL GENERAL STRIKE

ecuador's union federations called a general strike for next wednesday to press the governent to suspend austerity measures adopted recently to grapple with losses from a recent earthquake.     The 500,000-strong unitary workers' front (fut) and the 100,000-member general union of workers (ugt) have protested the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices of up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.     President leon febres cordero imposed the measures after a march 5 earthquake cost an estimated one billion dollars in losses. About 1,000 people are dead or missing.     The leftist-led fut said it was also backing a call by the maoist popular movement for democracy (mpd) party, to have congress impeach and oust febres cordero, a conservative, for having adopted the austerity measures.     Congress needs to muster two-thirds of the votes in the 71-seat congress to censure and oust the president, whose four-year presidential term ends in august 1988.     The congress last january 22 voted 38-29 to approve a non-binding resolution asking the president to resign for having allegedly violated laws and provoking his 12-hour abduction by air force paratroopers on january 16.
