Shooting erupted at Philippine army headquarters early this morning, an independent Manila radio station said.     Radio DZRH said it was checking unconfirmed reports that about 120 mutineers had surrounded an office building inside Fort Bonifacio.     An officer told Reuters an alert had been sounded at the camp.     A Reuter reporter at the camp said the gates had been sealed and guards were preventing anyone from going inside. REUTER &#3;
