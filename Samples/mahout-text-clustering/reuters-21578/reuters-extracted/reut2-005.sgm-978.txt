PACIFIC EXCHANGE OFFICIALS CONCLUDE CHINA TRIP

The Pacific Stock Exchange said officials of the exchange and other representatives from the U.S. concluded a 10-day trip to China to exchange information with Shanghai and Hong Kong financial executives.     The exchange said the trip was to explore potential trading links between PSE and other Pacific Rim exchanges and to discuss growth of capital markets in the Far East.     "This trip represents the PSE's first effort to provide technical assistance and begin cooperative relationships with exchanges and securities markets in the Pacific Rim," Maurice Mann, chairman of PSE, said in a statement.
