U.S. DEBT FUTURES LOWER IN QUIET OPEN

U.S. interest rate futures were lower in quiet early activity.     A weak dollar pressured debt futures. Remarks made yesterday by Council of Economic Advisers Beryl Sprinkel that the U.S. has no target value for the dollar continued to impact the market, traders said.     The market awaited action by finance ministers of the G-5 nations, who are to meet today.
