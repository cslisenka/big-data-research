CONGRESSMAN QUESTIONS INSIDER TRADING ENFORCEMENT

Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said Dennis Levine's conviction for insider trading showed the need for tougher enforcement of insider trading laws by the government and the securities industry.     Lent's comments came at the start of closed testimony by Levine at the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee. Levine's testimony was not released.     "Why didn't Dennis Levine's superiors at four different investment banking houses question the sources of his 'uncanny' information on possible corporate takeovers?" Lent asked.     "Why has the Securities and Exchange Commission historically been unable to prosecute insider trading cases without outside evidence that illegal behavior has taken place?" Lent added.     Lent said Levine had told the subcommittee staff his associates at major banks told him insider trading was accepted practice. Levine also said he did not worry about being caught by the SEC.     "The securities industry must stop putting morality and ethics behind proift. The SEC must exercise tougher control and supervision of the industry," Lent said.  Reuter &#3;
