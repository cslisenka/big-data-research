HONG KONG 1986/87 BUDGET SURPLUS ESTIMATE RAISED

Hong Kong's budget surplus for the 1986/1987 fiscal year has been revised to 3.7 billion H.K. Dlrs from a 3.1 billion dlr estimate made in February, Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said.     He told the Legislative Council that the revision for the year ended March 31, 1987 reflected higher than anticipated stamp tax revenues due to an active stock market.     The surplus for the fiscal year was initially estimated at 348 mln dlrs and was revised to 3.1 billion in Jacobs' budget presentation in February. The 1987/1988 budget surplus is estimated at 1.8 billion dlrs.  REUTER &#3;
