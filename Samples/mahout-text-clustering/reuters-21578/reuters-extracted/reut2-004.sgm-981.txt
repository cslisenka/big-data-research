GTE <GTE> COMMENTS ON JUSTICE DEP'T PROPOSALS

GTE Corp said it supports recommendations by the Department of Justice to allow the regional Bell companies to enter some new businesses but that it rejects the government's proposal to let the companies offer long distance services.     "As a vigorous competitor in many telecommunications businesses, GTE supports efforts by policy makers to preserve and promote fair opportunities for competition," GTE said in comments filed with the U.S. District Court, which oversees the regulation of the Bell companies.     But the Stamford, Conn.-based company added that entry by the regional Bell companies into the long distnce market "would set back the progress toward a truly competitive interexchange environment that has occurred."     GTE owns the largest independent telephone system in the country and manufacturers telecommunications equipment through joint ventures with <Fujitsu> of Japan and <Siemens AG> of West Germany.     GTE also holds a 50 pct stake in <US Sprint Communications Co>, the third-largest long distance carrier in the country.  Reuter &#3;
