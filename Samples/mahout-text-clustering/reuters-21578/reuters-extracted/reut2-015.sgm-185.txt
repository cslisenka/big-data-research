THIRD U.S. MARINE ARRESTED IN SPY SCANDAL

A third Marine has been arrested on suspicion of espionage in a growing sex-spy scandal involving security at both the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the American Consulate in Leningrad, the Pentagon said.     Sgt. John Joseph Weirick, 26, was arrested yesterday in California and jailed for questioning on suspicion of espionage while he served as a guard at the U.S. consulate in Leningrad for a year beginning in October, 1981, Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said.     Two other Marines were earlier charged with espionage at the Moscow Embassy and a third Marine, Staff Sgt. Robert Stufflebeam, was charged yesterday with failure to report contacts with Soviet women in Moscow, Sims told reporters.  Reuter &#3;
