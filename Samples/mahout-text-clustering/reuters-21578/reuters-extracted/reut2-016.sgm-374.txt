AMERITECH <AIT> MICHIGAN UNIT TO LOWER RATES

The Michigan Attorney General said it reached a settlement with Michigan Bell Telephone Co, a subsidiary of American Information Technologies Corp, which will reduce rates, resulting in 79.6 mln dlrs lower revenues to Michigan Bell.     The settlement reflects Michigan Bell's reduced federal income taxes resulting from tax reform legislation, and will be submitted for approval to the Public Service Commission, the Attorney General's office said.     The lower rates are expected to become effective July one, when Michigan Bell's tax rate falls to 34 pct from 46 pct.  Reuter &#3;
