SWEDISH VIROLOGIST UNVEILS NEW AIDS BLOOD TEST

A Swedish virologist unveiled a new AIDS blood test using synthetic antigens, or substances which combine with antibodies to make them detectable, which would be much cheaper and more reliable than existing tests.     Anders Vahlne said the test, developed at Gothenburg University, was accurate enough to eliminate the need for a second test usually carried out to double-check those found to be "AIDS positive," that is with AIDS antibodies in their blood.     Vahlne said the test could be on the market in between four and eight months. A small Swiss firm, Virovahl S.A., Helped finance it.  REUTER &#3;
