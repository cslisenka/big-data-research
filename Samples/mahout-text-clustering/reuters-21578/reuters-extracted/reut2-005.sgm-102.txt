NYSE SEES NO PROBLEM ON RULE 390 INTERPRETATION

The New York Stock Exchange sought to defuse a trans-Atlantic flap over whether member firms can trade stocks on London's electronic dealing system during New York trading hours.     "I don't know what the hub-bub is about," said Richard Torrenzano, NYSE spokesman. Some member firms had said they were worried that a strict interpretation of NYSE rule 390 curtail trading when London closes its trading floor next year and all trading is done via electronic systems.     "If the British Parliament calls it a stock exchange, that's good enough for us," Torrenzano said.     Torrenzano did not see any conflict with rule 390 if members wanted to trade in London. The rule, in effect since the mid 1970's, says in part, "During NYSE trading hours a member, a member organization or affiliated person may trade as principal or agent in any listed stock on any organized exchange of which they are a member, in any foreign country at any time."     "The rule has not been changed, there is nothing new here," he said.  Reuter &#3;
