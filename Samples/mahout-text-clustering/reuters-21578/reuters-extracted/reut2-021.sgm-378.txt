CALFED <CAL> POSTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

CalFed Inc said strong loan volume and higher net increase income at its principal subsidiary, the California Federal Savings and Loan Association, contributed to the best third-quarter and nine-month results in the company's history.     On a per-share basis, CalFed's fully diluted earnings were 1.80 dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 and 4.87 dlrs for the nine months ended Sept 30, 1987, compared with 1.75 dlrs and 4.76 dlrs in the comparable 1986 period.     CalFed is a 23.1 bln dlr diversified financial-services company.     "Key factors leading to the company's higher earnings were continued strong loan volume, an increase in net interest income and higher earnings from non-real estate sources," said George Rutland, president and chief executive officer of the firm of CalFed Inc.     Net earnings in the third quarter of 1987 were 50 mln dlrs, a 3.1 pct gain over 48.5 mln in the same period last year. They increased 3.9 pct in the first nine months of this year compared with last year, totalling 134.6 mln dlrs against 129.6 mln.     California Federal Savings and Loan Association contributed net earnings of 44.5 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 compared with 43.4 mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the nine-month period ended Sept 30, it had net earnings of 116.3 mln dlrs against 114.9 mln in the comparable 1986 period.     California Federal's net interest income for the third quarter of 1987 rose 18.1 pct to 131.6 mln dlrs, up from 111.4 mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the first nine months of 1987, it totalled 383 mln dlrs, a 13.9 pct increase over 336.2 mln in the comparable 1986 period.     CalFed Inc said that the increase in its subsidiary's net interest income was a result of higher average balances of interest-earning assets for the savings and loan operations.     CalFed said the savings and loan unit's loan originations were unchanged in the third quarter of 1987 compared with last year at 1.8 billion dlrs. But for the first nine months of 1987, they rose to 5.4 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion in 1996.     California Federal's provision for loan losses rose to 19.4 mln dlrs in the 1987 third quarter compared with 15.5 mln last year and to 63.3 mln for first the nine months of 1987 compared with 30.6 mln.
