CHINA SAYS 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT 7.08 BILLION YUAN

China posted a budget deficit of 7.08 billion yuan in 1986, the fourth highest since 1949, after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985, Finance Minister Wang Bingqian told the National People's Congress.     He put 1986 revenue at 222.03 billion yuan, against a budgeted 214.17 billion, and up from 185.41 billion in 1985, and expenditure at 229.11 billion, against a budgeted 214.17 billion and 182.59 billion in 1985.     Official figures show the record post-1949 budget deficit was 17 billion yuan in 1979.     Wang said the 1986 deficit was due to excess capital construction and administrative expenses and unjustified and extravagant investments outside the state plan.     He also blamed the inefficiency of firms whose production costs and losses rose. He said subsidising state firms' losses cost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give a separate figure for this.     He said the processing industry developed too fast and some projects could not start operations because of power shortages, while too many non-productive facilities were set up.     Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose 15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumption funds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth in national income.     Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in world oil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, a drop in income from customs duties and the rising cost of earning foreign exchange through exports.     Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate of depreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reduced their regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.     Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuan from 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to 6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loans rose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.     He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital construction rose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, on technical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from 10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expenses to 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science, education and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billion and defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.      Wang said expenditure for repaying principal and interest on foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan, up from 3.26 billion in 1985.  REUTER &#3;
