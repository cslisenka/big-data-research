MONSANTO <MTC> RESPONDS TO CALL FOR LAWSUIT

Monsanto Corp said a call by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency requesting the Illinois Attorney General file a lawsuit against the company is "inappropriate and counterproductive."     The company said the suit seeks to force Monsanto to replace the chlorosulphonic acid cooling system at its William G. Krummrich plant in Sauget, Ill.     Monsanto said the basis for the agency's action was an accident March Three in which the plant's acid unit experienced an emission due to a failed expansion joint in the cooling system.     Monsanto said when the environmental agency recommended that the company replace the present cooling system, it contacted the manufacturer of the system to seek outside technical advice.     Monsanto said its analysis indicated that the present system represents the safest technology for producing chlorosulfonic acid, and removal of the system with expansion joints would increase - not decrease - the chances of further accidents.
