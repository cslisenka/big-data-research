TRREASURY'S BAKER SEES NO TRADE WAR OVER TARIFFS

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the U.S. imposition of tariffs on Japanese goods over semiconductor trade does not signal the start of a trade war.     He also played down the significance of the precipitous stock market decline earlier this week.     "I don't think this action should be interpreted in any way as the start of a trade war," he said in response to a question from a House Appropriations subcommittee.     He said a drop in stock market prices of the magnitude experienced Monday was not so unusual.     "I don't think it is particularly unusual to see those kinds of days" on Wall Street, Baker said.     Since Monday, he added, "The stock market has rebounded rather vigorously."     He urged lawmakers to move cautiously on trade legislation to avoid overly protectionist moves which might aggravate world trade tensions.     "You're not going to legislate this (trade) deficit away," he told the panel.   Reuter &#3;
