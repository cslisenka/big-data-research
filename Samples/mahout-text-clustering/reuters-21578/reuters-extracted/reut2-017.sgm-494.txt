GENETECH <GENE.O> SEES FDA APPROVAL OF DRUG

Genetech Inc said it still remains confident that it will be able to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration to obtain approval of its tissue plasminogen activator Activase for use in treating heart attack victims.     On Friday an advisory committee of the FDA recommended that the blood clot dissolving drug not be approved until additional mortality data be developed.     Genetech said it will provide the additional data and believes that much if not all of it is already being developed.  Reuter &#3;
