GROUP SAYS U.S. HOSTAGE ILL, OFFERS SWAP

Kidnappers of four professors, three American and one Indian, said U.S. Hostage Alann Steen was ill and offered to free him in exchange for a hundred detainees in Israel.     "U.S. Spy Alann Steen began to suffer from illness, his health might deteriorate and he might die in 10 days," said a hand-written statement by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered to Beirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper.     "Our humanitarian motives require that we free him for 100 detainees in the occupation jails," said the statement, which was accompanied by a photograph of Steen.  REUTER &#3;
