HOUSE RESOLUTION URGES TREATY TO PROTECT OZONE

The House of Representatives passed a resolution urging President Reagan to negotiate a world-wide treaty to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons which are depleting the earth's ozone layer.     Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals used in aerosol sprays, refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insultation, fire extinguishers and cleaning solvents. They were banned in the United States and Canada in 1978, but are still widely used in Europe and Japan.         The ozone layer of the atmosphere protects the earth against ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.     Scientists have warned that if chlorofluocarbons continue to deplete the ozone layer, the additional ultraviolent radiation striking the earth will cause a higher rate of skin cancer.     The non-binding resolution was passed by voice vote.  Reuter &#3;
