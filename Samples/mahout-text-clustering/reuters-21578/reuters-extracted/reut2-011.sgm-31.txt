PAY 'N PAK <PNP> TO EXPLORE ITS ALTERNATIVES

Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc said it intends to explore all alternatives for the purpose of maximizing its value to stockholders.     The company said it also retained Salomon Brothers Inc as its financial advisor to assist it in this regard.     Last week investor Paul Bilzerian reported that he holds a 7.2 pct stake in Pay 'N Pak and is considering seeking control of the retail building materials firm.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Bilzerian said he and a Tampa, Fla., investment firm he controls called Bicoastal Financial Corp, may acquire additional Pay 'N Pak shares, or they may seek to acquire one or more positions on the company's board.     He also said in the filing that he may attempt to obtain  a controlling interest through a tender offer or otherwise.  Reuter &#3;
