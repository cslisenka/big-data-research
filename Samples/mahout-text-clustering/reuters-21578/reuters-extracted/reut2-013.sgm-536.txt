GREEK OFFICIAL SAYS AUSTERITY MEASURES PAYING OFF

Economy Undersecretary Yannos Papantoniou said the Greek economy was responding well to a two-year government austerity program.     He told reporters the evidence for this was in last year's figures, which showed a drop in inflation from 25 pct to 16.9 and a reduction in the current account deficit from 3.3 billion dlrs to 1.7 billion.     Papantoniou said indications were encouraging that a target of 1O pct inflation and a deficit of 1.25 billion dlrs would be reached by the end of 1987.  Reuter &#3;
