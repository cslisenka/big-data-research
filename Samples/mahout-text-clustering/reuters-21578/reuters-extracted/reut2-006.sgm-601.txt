BOEING<BA> SAYS NO "GIVE-AWAYS" FOR AWACS OFFSET

An official of Boeing Co said the company would not be handing out any "give-away" deals under its commitment to provide business worth 4.4 billion francs to French firms over eight years.     The U.S. Aircraft maker agreed last month to grant so-called "offset" contracts equivalent to 130 pct of the cost of France's purchase of three AWACS radar early warning planes.     "I would like to stress the need for competitiveness," said Lee Hessler, Business Manager for Boeing Aerospace Co's Information Systems Division.  Reuter &#3;
