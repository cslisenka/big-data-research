BALDRIGE SAYS U.S. MAY RETALIATE ON KANSAI

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he may recommend that the United States retaliate against Japan if the Japanese do not permit U.S. construction firms to participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport.     But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that U.S. firms would have a chance at the work.     "I think he will honor that commitment," Baldrige told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs."     He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States.  reuter &#3;
