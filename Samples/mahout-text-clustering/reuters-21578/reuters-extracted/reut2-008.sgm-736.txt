METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL <MFC> CLOSING 6 BRANCHES

Metropolitan Financial Corp said its Metropolitan Federal Bank subsidiary will close six North Dakota branches effective April 17, 1987, in an effort to streamline its operations.     Deregulation of the industry has made the bank holding company's extensive branch network, "somewhat costly and impractical," it said.     Metropolitan, with assets of more than two billion dlrs, said it is confident it can continue to serve the financial needs of those customers affected by the closings.  Reuter &#3;
