BENTSEN AWAITING RESPONSE ON ECONOMIC SUMMIT

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said he had been in touch with White House officials early on Tuesday on his proposal for an economic summit between Congress and the administration, but has yet to receive a response.     "I'm not at liberty to say what they're going to do yet," the Texas Democrat told an American Stock Exchange conference. "They're making up their minds."     Monday's stock market drop provides "additional leverage" for a meeting between White House officials and congressional leaders on trade and budget issues, Bentsen said.  Reuter &#3;
