HYDRO-QUEBEC SEES NO CANADA SALES OBLIGATION

Provincially-owned Hydro-Quebec said it had no obligation to supply electricity to other Canadian provinces if it could sell it at a higher price to Americans.     The utility told a National Energy Board hearing that U.S. utilities generally offer higher prices for electricity than those in Canada because the Americans want firm energy supplies.     Hydro-Quebec is seeking regulatory approval to sell 70 billion kilowatt hours of firm power a year to the New England power pool over 10 years starting in 1990. Utilities in Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland oppose the sale.  Reuter &#3;
