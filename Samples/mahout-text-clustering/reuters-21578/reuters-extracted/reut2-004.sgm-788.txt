LITTLE JOY FOR SWISS EXPORTERS, STUDY SAYS

The continued strength of the Swiss franc against the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of the benefits of the upturn in the world economy, a quarterly study by the Economics Department said.     It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost from the upturn in the economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and predicted declines in new orders for highly export-orientated firms.     However, domestic demand, which stagnated in the last quarter of 1986, would resume its growth, fuelled by higher real incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment, it said.     The study, which was drawn up by the department's Commission for Economic Questions, said industrial production would scarcely increase, with most firms apparently happy with current numbers of workers.     However, an increase in labour demand in the service sector should help push up total employment, it said.     The Commission also predicted an increase in inflation from current low levels.
