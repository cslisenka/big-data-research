LYNG SAYS AGRICULTURE SHOULD SHARE SPENDING CUTS

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said agriculture should share spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law and that this would ultimately help exports.     "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at least get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said. "Agriculture would not be independent from that."     He told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch, "I don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target."     Lyng said if the federal deficit came down, this would help exports. "A failure to get the fiscal deficit under control is having a harmful effect on agricultural exports."     He added, however, that U.S. agricultural exports had increased under the Farm Security Act but so far had not recovered to what he called the successful levels of 1981.  Reuter &#3;
