GULF AND WESTERN <GW> SEES RECORD FISCAL YEAR

Gulf and Western Inc chairman Martin Davis said the company will report record results for the current fiscal year.     In its last fiscal year ending October 31, the company earned 228.7 mln dlrs, or 3.66 dlrs a share, on revenues of 2.093 billion dlrs.     Earlier the company said its second quarter net rose to 86 cts a share from 73 cts a year ago. Davis said the company's Paramount Pictures Corp had strong momentum, and a substantial contribution is anticipated from the company's publishing operations in the third and fourth quarter.     Davis also said steady growth is expected in financial services operations, bolstered by the acquisition in May of Fruehauf's truck trailer financing and leasing business.     He said the company's entertainment operations should benefit significantly from Paramount's two major summer motion pictures, "Beverly Hills Cop II," which grossed 65 mln dlrs in its first 12 days of North American distribution, and "The Untouchables," which opens June 3.
