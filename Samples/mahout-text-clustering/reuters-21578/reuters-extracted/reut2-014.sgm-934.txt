JAPAN DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH ASIA URGED

Japan should promote division of labour with its Asian neighbours, especially the newly industrialized countries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth, the Bank of Japan said in a report.     Instead of trying to produce everything by itself, Japan should open up its market further to imports, transfer manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology transfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthly report.     Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as mere competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.     The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports manufactured goods to them.     But this has resulted in an increase in their trade deficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asian nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like the United States.
