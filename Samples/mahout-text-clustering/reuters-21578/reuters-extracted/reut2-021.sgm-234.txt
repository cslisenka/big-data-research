PROTESTERS MARCH AGAINST PRICE RISES IN SUDAN

About 10,000 people marched through the Sudanese capital Monday in protest against price increases and devaluation of the Sudanese pound.     The march was aimed at measures agreed with the International Monetary Fund, including devaluation of the Sudanese pound by 44 pct and a rise in sugar and petrol prices.     The devaluation was announced on October 3. Sudan's foreign debt costs an estimated one billion dlrs a year to service.  REUTER &#3;
