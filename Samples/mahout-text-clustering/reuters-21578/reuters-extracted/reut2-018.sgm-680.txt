DONORS PLEDGE 3.15 BILLION DLRS INDONESIAN AID

Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.     This compares with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last year's meeting, the statement said. It is also well above the World Bank's recommendation of 2.5 billion guilders in aid for the coming year.     "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," the statement said.     The statement said Indonesia must take further steps to set the stage for resumed economic growth that could create employment for the country's rapidly growing labour force.     "These measures include additional significant trade and industrial deregulation," the statement said.     It also called for policies supporting efficient and diversified growth of agriculture, and said Jakarta should give more room to the private sector. It called on Indonesia to mobilise more domestic resources to finance development programs.  REUTER &#3;
