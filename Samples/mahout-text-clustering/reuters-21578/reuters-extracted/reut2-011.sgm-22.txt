U.S. SENATE BUDGET CHIEF EYES FARM POLICY CHANGE

U.S. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles' (D-Fla.) fiscal 1988 budget plan would cut farm spending by about two billion dlrs, primarily by making unspecified changes in price and income support programs, Senate staff members said.     Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week and said he would like to begin voting on it this week.     Senate Republican staff members said Chiles was recommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.     While savings from the changes would accrue mainly in fiscal 1989, Chiles said his income and price support proposals would trim about two billion dlrs from advance deficiency payments, most of which would be made in the spring of next year.     It was not clear how the Senate Budget panel head would achieve the savings in Commodity Credit Corp outlays. Aides to Chiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.     Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a report listing possible price and income support program savings.     The options included lowering target prices, increasing unpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income support payments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use of generic commodity certificates, raising loan rates and "decoupling" income support payments from production decisions.     Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing the U.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functions which include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.     The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrs for organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid.  Reuter &#3;
