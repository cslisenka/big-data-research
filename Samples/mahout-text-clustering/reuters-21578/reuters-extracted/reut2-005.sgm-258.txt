CATHAY PACIFIC WINS TORONTO ROUTE LICENSE

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK> has won a two-year license from the Hong Kong government to operate scheduled flights to Toronto, a Cathay spokesman said.     He told Reuters the airline had sought a five-year right to add Toronto to its existing license to serve the United States and Canada.     "We're pleased," the spokesman said. "It's important because Toronto has a large ethnic Chinese commmunity and there's a growing amount of travel."     Canadian and British authorities must agree on air service rights before Cathay can begin service to toronto.     Cathay Pacific is controlled by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC. HK>.     Hongkong Dragon Airlines Ltd, a fledgling locally  based airline, had opposed the move, saying that Cathay should wait until its license for its U.S. And Canadian routes expires in February next year.     A hearing started today and continues tomorrow. An application by Dragonair is to start flights to Malaysian cities including Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. Cathay is opposing Dragonair's request.
