BRITAIN WANTS BANK REGULATION DEAL WITH JAPAN

Britain wants Japan to agree a timetable for work towards joint rules on capital adequacy for banks along the lines of a January outline agreement between the U.S and the U.K., Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said.     Howard told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets "I want to see an agreement between us on what progress is to be made and the rate at which it will happen."     Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairs Toyoo Gyohten told the conference yesterday he was ready to discuss capital adequacy, but no negotiations were planned and he could not see how or when agreement would be reached.     Howard said another issue he would raise during a visit to Japan, starting on April 13, was equal access for U.K. Financial firms to the Japanese market.     He said 14 London-based financial firms were based in Tokyo, nine of them wholly British, with licences to deal in securities. This compared with 58 wholly-licensed Japanese firms in London.     "I am not a protectionist. We welcome all these firms here. But I want our firms to be able to compete just as freely in Japan and at the moment they are not allowed to do so," he said.
