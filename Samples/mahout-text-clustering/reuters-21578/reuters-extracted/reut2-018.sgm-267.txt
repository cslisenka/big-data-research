SENATE CLEARS WAY FOR PASSAGE OF MONEY BILL

The Senate cleared away a parliamentary obstacle threatening final passage of a 9.4 billion dlr money bill for the rest of fiscal 1987 ending October 1.     The Senate voted 64 to 32 to override objections the bill's money total violated the 1987 budget, a vote that required 60 votes for approval.     The House-passed measure, debated by the Senate since May 7, carries funds for most government activities with the bulk --6.7 billion dlrs--for agriculture support programs.     Final passage could come late tonight or tomorrow.  Reuter &#3;
