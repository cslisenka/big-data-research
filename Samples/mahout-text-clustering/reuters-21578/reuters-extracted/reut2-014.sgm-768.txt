TEXACO <TX> GETS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

Texaco Inc said it obtained a temporary restraining order from the Texas court of appeals against Pennzoil Co <PZL> taking action to enforce a multi-billion dlr judgment against Texaco.     A Texas jury last year found that Texaco interfered with Pennzoil's attempt to acquire Getty Oil Co last year and awarded Pennzoil more than 10 billion dlrs in damages.     Texaco said the temporary restraining order was a positive initial step.     A spokesman said arguments will begin in the Texas State Court of Appeal in Houston on April 13 on Texaco's request for relief from the full bond and lien requirement, which equal the amount of the judgment.
