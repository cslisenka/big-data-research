REUTERS <RTRSY> IN PROPERTY FINANCE SYSTEM

Reuters Holdings PLC's Reuters Information Services Inc subsidiary and Real Estate Financing Partnership of Philadelphia said they have developed RSVP, an electronic market access system for commercial property financing.     The companies said the system, on completion of testing, will use the Reuter communications network to provide a confidential method for the purchasing, selling and financing of commercial property. They said principal participants in RSVP are expected to be private and institutional commercial real estate owners, brokers, purchasers and investors.     The companies said the system, which will operate in domestic and international markets, is expected to be particularly useful to mortgage brokers and loan correspondents.     They said Reuters will provide systems software, hardware and telecommunications capabilities and support under a long-term working agreement with Real Estate Financing Partnership and will also provide sales assistance and marketing support to Real Estate Financing.     Real Estate Financing designed RSVP.     The companies said RSVP will use Reuter Monitor technology and the Reuter private communications network to provide a global financing capability for commercial real estate ventures. It will enable parties seeking real estate financing to identify funding sources on a private basis.     They said the system is scheduled for testing in August in selected U.S. cities and is expected to be operational about 90 days after initial testing.  Reuter &#3;
