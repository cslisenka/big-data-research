S. AFRICA MINING HOUSE REPORTS HUGE STRIKE LOSSES

A major South African mining house on Monday reported two of its gold mines suffered huge losses as a result of a black miners' strike in August which crippled about half the country's crucial gold mines.     Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, one of the six major mining houses, said the two mines suffered a combined net loss of 9.7 mln dlrs in the three months to end-September compared with a profit of 8.6 mln dlrs in the preceding quarter.     It was the first indication of the real economic impact of the biggest wage strike in the history of the gold mining industry, which accounts for nearly half the value of South Africa's total exports.     "The results were pretty disastrous, primarily due to the impact of the strike," Ken Maxwell, head of Johannesburg Consolidated's gold division, told a news conference in Johannesburg.     "We haven't recovered from the strike yet," he said, adding that 70 percent of underground mining at the group's biggest mine, Randfontein Estates, was halted by the three-week strike.     Johannesburg Consolidated and its controlling company, the giant Anglo American Corp., were hard-hit by the three-week miners' strike, but refused to disclose production losses.     Anglo American is due to report its quarterly gold-mine profits later this week.  Reuter &#3;
