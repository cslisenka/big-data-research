NO DECISION YET ON RENAMING VOLCKER AT FED

The White House said President Reagan had made no decision on whether to reappoint Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Volcker's term expires in August.     "No decision has been made on chairman Volcker ... He has not discussed this with the president, and no decision has been made one way or another," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.     Asked if Reagan would discuss the issue with Volcker before leaving for the Venice summit on Wednesday, Fitzwater said, "I have no idea."  Reuter &#3;
