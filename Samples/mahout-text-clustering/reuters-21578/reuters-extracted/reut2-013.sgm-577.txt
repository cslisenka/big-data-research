LONDON SOFT FUTURES ADOPT NEW CLEARING PROCEDURES

London's soft futures markets, namely cocoa, coffee and sugar, are adopting with immediate effect a uniform presentation on their respective open positions referring to previous day's trading figures, a spokeswoman for the London Commodity Exchange (LCE) said.     The figures represent total clients' long positions as well as short positions, plus the net house positions as submitted by all members for each delivery month, she said.     As a result, figures will differ from those previously published but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare more favourably with other international markets, she added.     Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure last October, which incorporated a system of "mark-to-market', figures as published bore little relationship to the true open position, the spokeswoman said.     The open position for business done up to the previous trading day is prepared daily by the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) and then posted on the various market notice boards.
