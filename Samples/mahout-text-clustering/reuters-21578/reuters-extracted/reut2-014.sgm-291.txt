LIVE CATTLE FUTURES MIXED AT MIDSESSION

Live cattle futures continued to trade unevenly and at midsession prices stood 0.17 cent higher to 0.25 lower with spot April pacing the gain and distant April off most.     Mixed profit-taking continued to partly offset demand prompted by further gains in cash cattle and private reports of higher cash beef prices. All months posted new season's highs early before slipping, traders said.     Market ready supplies of cattle remain tight and a rising wholesale carcass beef and boxed beef market is prompting good packer interest for cash cattle. Strong stoppers of deliveries added to strength in April, they said.  Reuter &#3;
