BRISTOL-MYERS <BMY> SEEKS AIDS VACCINE TESTING

Bristol-Myers Co <BMY> said it would seek Food and Drug Administration permission to test its AIDS vaccine in humans by the end of March.     A company spokesman said the company will file an investigational new drug application by the end of the month, requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.     Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS virus.     Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.     The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity against AIDS.
