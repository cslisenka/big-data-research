SOUTH KOREA PREMIER OFFERS TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA

South Korea proposed a meeting of prime ministers to improve relations with North Korea, but said the two countries must first restore mutual trust.     South Korean Prime Minister Lho Shin-yong proposed in a letter to his North Korean counterpart Li Gun-mo that they meet to "discuss ... Various issues raised by the two sides to improve relations and ease tension."     The letter, released to the media by a government spokesman, said if the proposed meeting took place it would open the way for summit talks between South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung.     The letter was in reply to a recent North Korean call for high-level political and military talks.     Lho said the prime ministers could discuss any proposal to be made by the North, once "the minimum conditions for mutual trust have been created by the convening of a water resources meeting and the resumption of the suspended dialogues."     Lho was referring to discussions on a controversial northern dam project Seoul has said is aimed at flooding large areas of the South, and to a resumption of stalled talks on trade and humanitarian issues.
