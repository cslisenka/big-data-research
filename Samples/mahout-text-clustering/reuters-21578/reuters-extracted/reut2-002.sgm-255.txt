SPANISH METAL WORKERS REJECT 1987 WAGE OFFER

Spain's metal workers, the biggest organised labour force, broke off talks with employers over 1987 wages, union sources said.     The main Socialist and Communist unions rejected an offer from the Confemetal employers' organization for a six pct wage rise, one point above the government inflation target for 1987. The metal working industry has 900,000 workers in 60,000 factories.     The unions said they were considering a bid to resume talks next week.  REUTER &#3;
