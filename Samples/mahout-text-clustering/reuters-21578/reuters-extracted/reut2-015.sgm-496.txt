BIOSYSTEMS RESEARCH TESTS TECHNOLOGY FOR AIDS

<Biosystems Research Inc> said its new technique for a treatment for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome showed good results on subjects who were treated.     Called biostimulation, the non-drug approach to the treatment of those with AIDS and AIDS related complex involves exposure to low-level magnetic and electrical stimulation in combination with phototherapy from the visible light spectrum, the company said.         Biosystems said it tested its technique in two studies with eight subjects since January 1986, for periods of five to 60 weeks. It said the treatments have not produced any adverse effects in the subjects.  Reuter &#3;
