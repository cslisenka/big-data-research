CANADIAN BONDS CLOSE LOWER

Canadian bonds extended mild losses from early activity to close up to 3/4 of a point lower in moderate trading, dealers said.     The decline reflected investor concern about economic trends, coupled with the sharp afternoon downturn in U.S. bond markets on firm oil prices and the uncertain outlook for the U.S. dollar, traders said.     The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001, off 1/8 in early trading, closed behind 5/8 at 105-3/4 7/8, while the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 lost 3/4 from last night to 96-5/8 7/8.  Reuter &#3;
