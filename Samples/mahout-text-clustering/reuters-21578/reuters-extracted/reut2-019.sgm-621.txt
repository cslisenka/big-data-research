PENNWALT <PSM> INTRODUCES NEW REFRIGERANT

Pennwalt Corp said it is making a new refrigerant available as an alternative to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) 12, a product suspected of depleting the earth's ozone layer.     The company said the new product, called isotron 142b/22, is a blend of partially halogenated CFCs, and has less than five pct of the ozone depletion potential of CFC 12, which is fully halogenated.     According to the company, the blend is currently used to replace CFC 12 as a propellant in aerosol containers, and has been successfully tested as a refrigerant.         Pennwalt manufactures chemicals, pharmaceuticals and precision equipment.  Reuter &#3;
