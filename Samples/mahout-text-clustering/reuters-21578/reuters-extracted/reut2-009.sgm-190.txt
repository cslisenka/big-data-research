BELGIAN PUBLIC DEBT RISES IN FEBRUARY

Belgian public debt rose a nominal 89.5 billion francs in February to 5,591.1 billion francs, and compared with 5,074.2 billion in February 1986, the finance ministry said in its monthly statement.     It said after taking into account operations with the International Monetary Fund and foreign exchange fluctuations, the figure corresponding to the government's net financing requirement in February was 86.0 billion francs.     This is below the February 1986 figure of 91.1 billion francs.     However in the first two 1987 months, the amount corresponding to the net financing requirement was 184.2 billion francs against 183.9 billion in the same period of 1986, the Ministry said.     The Belgian government is aiming to cut the financing requirement for the whole of 1987 to around 420 billion francs from 561 billion last year through a major spending cuts program.  REUTER &#3;
