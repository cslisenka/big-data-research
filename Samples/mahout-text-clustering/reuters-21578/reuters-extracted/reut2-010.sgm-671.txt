JAPAN VTR PRODUCTION FALLS IN FEBRUARY

Japan's video tape recorder (VTR) production fell 10.4 pct from a year earlier to 2.18 mln sets in February for the third successive year-on-year drop, reflecting slow exports, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan said.     But February output was up 27.2 pct from a month earlier.     Colour television production rose 5.7 pct from a year earlier to 1.20 mln sets in February after 15 consecutive year-on-year drops. The February increase over a year ago reflected higher domestic sales. The production was up 38.5 pct from a month earlier.  REUTER &#3;
