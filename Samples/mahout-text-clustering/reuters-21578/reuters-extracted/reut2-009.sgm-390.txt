BRAZILIAN BANK STRIKE SPREADS, UNION SAYS

A nationwide bank strike launched yesterday by Brazilian bank workers gained more support today with the closure of the <Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo> (Banespa) in Sao Paulo, a union spokesman said.     The spokesman said about 530,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bank workers were on strike. He said the chief development since yesterday was the decision by the city's 20,000 Banespa workers to come out on strike. Banespa is the Sao Paulo state bank.     State-controlled <Banco do Brasil SA>, with over 3,000 branches throughout the country, closed down yesterday.     Bank industry sources say the closure of the Banco do Brasil will soon force the shutdown of the many private banks which are not strike-bound.     The bankworkers are seeking an immediate pay rise of 100 pct and monthly salary adjustments.     A spokesman for the National Federation of Banks, Adilson Lorente, said that yesterday only 30 pct of private banks' branches were strike-bound. He had no estimate of how many workers were on strike or any information on the percentage of branches open today.  REUTER E &#3;
