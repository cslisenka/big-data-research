MERCANTILE <MTRC.O> RAISES RESERVE, SEES LOSS

Mercantile Bancorp Inc said it will add a special provision of 75 mln dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses in the second quarter, and expects to report a loss of 33 mln dlrs during the period.     The company estimated it will report net income of two mln dlrs during the full year 1987.     Mercantile Bancorp said the additional provision represents 28.5 pct of Mercantile Bancorp's 263 mln dlrs in total outstanding loans to Latin American countries. The special provision will raise the reserve to 148 mln dlrs, or 3.1 pct of the company's 4.7 billion dlrs total loans.     Mercantile Bancorp earned 19.5 mln dlrs in last year's second quarter, or 1.23 dlrs a share, and 55.6 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share for the full year 1986.     Mercantile Bancorp's reaffirmed its intention to continue the present dividend and to follow its normal policy of basing future dividends on anticipated earnings from ongoing business.     "It now appears the adjustment process for heavily indebted countries could stretch into the 1990's, and these restructurings may have negative economic effects on the loan portfolio," Mercantile Bancorp said.
