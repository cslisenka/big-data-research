SOCAL EDISON PLANS NO MAJOR NEW PLANTS

Southern California Edison Co <SCE> Chairman Howard Allen said the company plans no new major construction projects in the next eight years.     "We plan no new major plant additions until at least the mid-1990s and maybe longer," Allen told a renewable energy conference here.     He said Southern California Edison had peak power reserve margins greater than 20 pct last year. Allen also said he expects renewable and alternate energy sources, such as solar and geothermal power, to contribute as much as 26 pct of the company's electricity within 10 years.  Reuter &#3;
