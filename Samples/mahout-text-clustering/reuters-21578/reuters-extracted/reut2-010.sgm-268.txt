NTT CONSIDERING BUYING CRAY SUPERCOMPUTER

<Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co> (NTT) is considering buying a Cray II supercomputer worth some three billion yen from Cray Research Inc <CYR>, and a decision is expected in early April, an NTT official said.     He told Reuters NTT was considering the Cray machine because of its superior operational speed and memory capacity, and not because of any pressure to buy foreign hardware.     Industry sources said foreign frustration was growing over lack of access to Japan's semiconductor and telecommunications markets, and Washington had criticised Japanese government agencies for not buying U.S. Supercomputers.
