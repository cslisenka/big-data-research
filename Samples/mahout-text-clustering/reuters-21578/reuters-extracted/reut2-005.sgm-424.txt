S/P DOWNGRADES KINGDOM OF DENMARK

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded to AA from AA-plus the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt.     The action affects the equivalent of 17.6 billion U.S. dlrs of debt.     S and P cited Denmark's weakened external competitiveness, saying it contributed to a steady deterioration of the country's current account balance and a substantial rise in its external debt burden.     Net foreign debt increased to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P pointed out.     Standard and Poor's said that while it expects lower imports and current account imbalances this year, rising labor costs should further weaken Denmark's competitiveness.     However, S and P said its downgrade did not affect the A-1-plus short-term debt rating of Denmark or its wholly owned Danish Oil and Natural Gas.     Similarly, the AA ratings on the long-term debt obligations of Copenhagen County Authority and I/S Elsam were affirmed.  Reuter &#3;
