CONGRESS PASSES APPLIANCE STANDARD BILL

Congress passed and sent to President Reagan a bill that sets energy efficiency standards for major household appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, washers and dryers and furnances.     Final action came on a voice vote in the House. The Senate had passed the bill, 89-6, on February 17.     Reagan vetoed a similar bill last year after Congress had adjourned, but has indicated he will sign this measure.     The standards will take effect over the next six years and appliance manufacturers will then have five years to redesign their appliances to meet the standards.  Reuter &#3;
