LONE STAR <LCE> SEES FLAT U.S. CEMENT DEMAND

Lone Star Industries Inc expects demand for cement om the U.S. to remain in the 85-90 mln ton range through 1992, its annual report said.     The company said U.S. cement consumption totaled 90.6 mln tons last year, up four pct from 1985.     Lone Star also said it expects consolidation and internationalization of the U.S. cement industry to continue, adding foreign companies now own over 50 pct of U.S. capacity.     Since 1974, it added, more  than 30 cement plants have closed. "In our opinion, the industry's annual cement capacity today is, in reality, less than 80 mln tons" a year, it added.     Lone Star said the gap between supply and demand is being filled by imported cement, which accounted for 18 pct of domestic consumption last year, up from four pct ten years ago.  Reuter &#3;
