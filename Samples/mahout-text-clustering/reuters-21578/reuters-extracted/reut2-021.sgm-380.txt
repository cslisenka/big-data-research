BANK PURCHASE SLOWS SECURITY PACIFIC <SPC> NET

Security Pacific Corp <SPC> said growth in its third-quarter earnings was slowed by the purchase of Rainier Bancorp and the suspension of interest payments on Brazilian and Ecuadorian loans that were placed on a non-accrual status earlier this year.     The bank said it earned 128.1 mln dlrs in the third quarter, up from 118.3 mln a year earlier. On a per-share basis, income was 1.16 dlrs a share, up from 1.09 dlrs.     The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrs associated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlr Seattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.     Security Pacific also said the suspension of interest payments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced net income by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.     Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier on August 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated to reflect the "pooling-of-interests" acquisition.     "Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearly demonstrating the stability and balance in our earnings streams," said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executive officer. "The addition of Rainier," he continued, "adds very significantly to the strength of our western banking network."     The inclusion of Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest earnings affected comparison of most financial categories.     Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was 602.4 mln dlrs, up from 538.6 mln. The suspension of interest payments on Brazilizan and Ecuadorian debt reduced net interest income by 41.9 mln dlrs.     Non-interest income rose to 471.6 mln dlrs from 412.1 mln.     Third-quarter provision for credit losses was 89.6 mln dlrs, down 17.9 mln dlrs. As a percentage of average loans and lease financing, net credit losses were 0.68 pct, down from 0.79 pct a year earlier.     Non-performing loans and leases were 2.038 billion dlrs at the end of the quarter, or 3.96 pct of loans and leases, up from 1.377 billion a year ago.     Other non-interest expense, composed of staff and other expenses, was 757.6 mln dlrs, up from 616.2 mln. The rise included an increase in staff expenses to 379.7 mln dlrs from 313.0 mln dlrs.     Excluding Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest, average loans grew 11 pct. Real estate and international loan growth had the greatest rises of 16 pct and 15 pct, respectively.     Shareholders equity was 3.486 billion dlrs at the end of the third quarter, up from 3.381 billion.     The primary capital ratio was 7.41 pct, based on period-end capital and quarterly average assets, up from 7.01 pct a year earlier.  Reuter &#3;
