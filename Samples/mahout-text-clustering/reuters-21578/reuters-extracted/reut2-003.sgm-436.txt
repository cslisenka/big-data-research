POLES SAID HELD IN JAPAN ON COMPUTER THEFT CHARGES

Police arrested two Polish citizens for trying to steal Japanese computer technology, local media reports said today.     The reports said the two had worked at a computer-related company in Tokyo and visited Japanese computer makers several times after coming to Japan on tourist visas last October.     One report said they were computer specialists at a Polish technology institute, and that the company they worked for was managed by a naturalised Japanese from Poland who was a graduate of the institute.     Police officials declined to comment on the reports.  REUTER &#3;
