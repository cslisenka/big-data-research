HANDELSBANKEN STAFF LOSE 100 MLN CROWNS IN DEALS

A share options dealer with Svenska Handelsbanken <SHBS.ST> and his office manager have lost the bank more than 100 mln crowns in unauthorised dealing, the bank said in a statement.     Handelsbanken said the two made the losses, calculated according to Monday's bourse prices, when they carried out unauthorised transactions for themselves and clients.     But the bank was insured against such an event and the loss would not affect its results, said head of the bank's treasury department, Lars Nyberg.     "The bank inspection authorities have been told and the police are also going to be informed," Nyberg told Reuters.     The affair was discovered by routine checks after the bourse falls of the past few days, he added.  REUTER &#3;
