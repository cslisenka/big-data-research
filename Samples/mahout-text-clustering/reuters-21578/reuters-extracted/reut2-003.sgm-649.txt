CURFEW CLAMPED ON NIGERIAN STATE AFTER CLASHES

Nigeria's military government clamped a dusk-to-dawn curfew on northern Kaduna state and ordered all schools and colleges there closed after 11 people died in clashes between Moslems and Christians.     A statement said the situation in Kaduna was now under control, after two days of disturbances caused by "undesirable elements hiding under the cover of religion."     The statement, signed by Rear-Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, the regime's number two, urged the media to exercise restraint in reporting the clashes which began last weekend in Kafanchan, a Christian enclave in the mainly-Moslem north.
