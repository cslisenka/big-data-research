It also said the agreements provide for payment of per unit royalty payments which may exceed the amount of the fixed royalty payments, depending on production of the chips by the licensees. The per unit payments will be made starting in the second quarter.     The companies included in the settlement are <Fujitsu Ltd>, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MC>, <Mitsubishi Corp>, <Oki>, <Sharp Corp> and <Toshiba Corp>.     The company said the dispute is still continuing with Hitachi Ltd <HIT>, NEC Corp <NIPNY>, and <Samsung>.
