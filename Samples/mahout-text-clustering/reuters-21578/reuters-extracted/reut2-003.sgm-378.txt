AIRBUS HAS NO COMMENT ON MCDONNELL TALKS

European consortium Airbus Industrie said it had no comment on press reports that it had resumed talks with U.S. McDonnell Douglas Corp over a possible joint development and production of airliners.     A spokesman at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse said in a telephone interview: "We have no knowledge of talks and have no comment to make."     Talks broke off last autumn after the two rivals failed to agree on cooperation over a new long-range jet. McDonnell Douglas wanted Airbus to help build its MD-11, while Airbus insisted McDonnell drop the MD-11 and cooperate over its A340.  Reuter &#3;
