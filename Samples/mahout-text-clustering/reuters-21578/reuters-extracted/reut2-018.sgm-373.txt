ISRAELI INFLATION 0.6 PCT IN MAY

Israel's inflation rate for May was 0.6 pct, the lowest since last July when there was no increase, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.     In April, inflation was 2.2 pct and the figure for May last year was 1.6 pct. The rate for the first five months of 1987 was 7.5 pct, the bureau said.     The annual inflation rate for the past 12 months was 20.3 pct, a bureau spokesman said.     Israeli inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 400 pct until the government imposed an austerity plan controlling wages and prices in mid-1985.  REUTER &#3;
