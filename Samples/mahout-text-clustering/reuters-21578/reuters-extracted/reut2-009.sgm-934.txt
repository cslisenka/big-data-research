SWEDISH BANK, U.S. FIRM PLAN U.K. STOCK VENTURE

Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken said it will set up a joint venture in London with U.S. brokerage firm Equitable Securities Corp of Nashville, Tenn., for the sale of U.S. equities in Europe.     S-E Bank's managing director Jacob Palmstierna told a press briefing that the joint venture, called Equitable Enskilda Securities Ltd, will be established next month.     S-E Bank bought a 4.9 pct stake in Equitable Securities about two weeks ago. Equitable's role in the joint venture will include provision of research on firms in the south-east United States.
