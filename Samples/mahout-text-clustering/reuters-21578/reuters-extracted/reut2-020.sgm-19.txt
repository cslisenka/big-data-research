TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE WILL NOT SUSPEND TRADING

Tokyo Stock Exchange president Michio Takeuchi said the exchange has no immediate plans to suspend trading to cool off panic stock selling.     However, he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if the London and New York exchanges are closed overnight.     "I don't think it will happen," he added.     He also told reporters the exchange will relax margin requirements effective on Wednesday to encourage stock buying.     Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly due to psychological factors.     "We need to keep close watch on market movement but we expect the market will stabilise soon," he said, adding that individual investors should remain calm. "It is advisable to wait for an autonomous recovery of the market," he said.     The margin requirement in cash will be reduced to 50 pct from 70 pct while the margin collateral requirement in equity will rise to 70 pct from 60 pct, effective on Wednesday, he said.     Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan to take coordinated action with the New York and London exchanges to help stabilise stock prices.     The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors but was primarily the result of a correction of overvalued share prices, he said. The current stock price plunge cannot compare with the Great Depression as the economic environment is very different, he added.     The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stock futures trading next year despite press reports that the Wall Street fall was linked with futures trading, he said.  REUTER &#3;
