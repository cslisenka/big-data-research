MACAO PACT DETAILS  RELEASED AFTER THURSDAY SIGNING

Details of today's agreement to hand over Portuguese-ruled Macao to China will be released after the official signing in Peking on Thursday, Portuguese Ambassador to Peking Octavio Valerio said.     Valerio earlier told reporters that the tiny territory would be returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, but gave no further details.     A statement issued today did not give details of the agreement as earlier expected.     "We are very happy with the results," Valerio said after four days of negotiations in the Chinese capital.     The talks were the fourth in a series on the Macao question and had been expected to focus on the status of the 40,000 Portuguese passport-holders among Macao's 400,000 residents.     Asked if the issue of nationality after the Chinese takeover had been a problem in the talks, Valerio replied: "It was one of them."     China traditionally opposes granting dual nationality to its citizens and requires holders of foreign passports to give up their Chinese citizenship.     In Taipei, Taiwan said it would not recognise the agreement. A Foreign Ministry statement said: "We regard the agreement on the Macao issue as null and void."     It said: "Macao should be returned to the Republic of China on Taiwan because communist China, a rebel entity, has no right to represent China and all the Chinese people.     "The handover by the Portuguese government is in disregard of the freedom, welfare and safety of more than 400,000 Chinese people there. We will try our upmost to help and protect them."     Taiwan's Kuomintang (Nationalist) government claims to rule all China. It has no diplomatic relations with Portugal.  REUTER &#3;
