JAGUAR OFFERS NEW LUXURY SEDAN

Jaguar Cars Inc, a subsidiary of Jaguar PLC, said it introduced its new 1988 XJ6 luxury sedan to replace its Series III XJ6 sedan.     The 40,500-dlr car will be available in showrooms starting May four, the company said.     Many parts of the XJ6 and the 44,500 dlr Vanden Plas have been changed, adding high-tech features. The car has seven micro-processors that control its major electrical functions. The in-car computer offers a wide array of trip information.     The Vanden Plas offers more features than the basic XJ6.     Jaguar said it has a "substantial waiting list" for the cars in Europe, where it was introduced last October.  Reuter &#3;
