U.S SUBCOMMITTEE APPROVES DEVELOPMENT BANK FUNDS

A House Banking subcommittee approved a bill authorizing U.S. contributions to the International Development Association, the Asian Development Fund and the Afrian Development Bank.     The bill authorizes 2.875 billion dlrs as the U.S. contribution to the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association, 584.3 mln dlrs to the Asian Development Fund and 719.5 mln dlrs to buy 59,648 shares of the capital stock of the African Development Bank.     The bill, which now goes to the full Banking Committee, includes an amendment opposing U.S. approval of development bank loans for commodities in surplus in the world and which are intended for export.
