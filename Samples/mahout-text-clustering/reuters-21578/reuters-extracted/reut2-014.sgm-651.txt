LITTLE INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT - DATA GENERAL <DGN>

Data General Corp president Edson de Castro said the general outlook for his company and for the industry shows "little fundamental improvement."     Citing the computer industry's dependence on capital investments, de Castro termed the environment "lackluster" and declined to predict the timing of a possible upturn.     Data General is "taking its show on the road" to educate its customers and targeted prospects, de Castro told a press briefing initiating a three-day exposition here of Data General's computer systems' capabilities.     Data General has targeted for its future growth increased participation in the industries of banking, insurance, brokerage, health care, manufacturing, petrochemical and the U.S. government.
