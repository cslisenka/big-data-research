FEDERAL EXPRESS <FDX> PURSUES OVERSEAS ROUTE

Federal Express Corp said it received a recommendation from an administrative law judge that it be awarded the exclusive air express route between the U.S. and Japan.     Federal Express said the recommendation now must be approved by the Secretary of Transporation Elizabeth Dole and President Reagan.     Federal Express said it received late last year preliminary approval by a panel over a consortium of United Parcel Service and DHL, and other air express competitors.  Reuter &#3;
