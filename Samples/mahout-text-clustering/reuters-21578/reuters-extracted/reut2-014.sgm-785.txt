TOKYO GOLD FUTURES OPEN SLIGHTLY FIRMER

Yen-denominated gold futures opened mostly firmer, with contracts unchanged to eight yen per gram higher, after falls yesterday, dealers said.     Gold closed stronger and near the day's highs in New York yesterday, underpinned by a buoyant silver market, they noted.     This generated sporadic buying at the opening here but investors continue to focus interest on the silver market, they said.     International bullion firmed to 423.00/423.50 dlrs an ounce from 422.25/3.25 in New York.  REUTER &#3;
