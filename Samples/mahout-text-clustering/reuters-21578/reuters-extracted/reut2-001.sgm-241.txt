Hewlett Packard Co said it unveiled the HP LaserJet Series II printer, the next generation of its laser printer line.     The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500 dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing.     It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan documents.     The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000, its first printer designed to be used with personal computer networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print 20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs.     It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device  that scans printed images of text.
