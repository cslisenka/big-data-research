BANKING TRADE GROUP SAYS BANK PROFITS DOWN

The American Bankers Association said the profitability of the nation's commercial banks declined by 12 pct during the first three quarters of 1986.     During the first nine months of last year, the industry's annualized rate of return on assets dropped to 0.68 pct from 0.77 pct in the same period in 1985, the ABA said. Return on equity fell to 10.8 pct from 12.3 pct the previous year.     Despite the decline in profits, the ABA said banks' capital grew boosting the industry's capital ratio to 6.4 pct from 6.3 pct.     The number and size of banks losing money during the period increased significantly, the ABA said.     During the first nine months of 1986, 17.5 pct of banks, holding 9.6 pct of banking assets, were unprofitable, the group said. That compares with 13 pct of banks, holding 8.8 pct of assets, during the same period in 1985, it said.     The industry's provisions for loan losses increased to 0.73 pct of assets during the period, up from 0.59 pct of assets during the same period in 1985, the group said.  Reuter &#3;
