DOLLAR OPENS EASIER IN TOKYO

The dollar opened easier against major currencies on underlying negative sentiment, but is likely to move marginally ahead of expected meetings of leading Finance Ministers in Washington this week, dealers said.     The dollar is expected to move between 145.00 and 145.60 yen today as operators avoid taking big positions, despite low expectations from any Washington talks, dealers said. The dollar's upward potential looks limited as selling interest appears strong around 145.60 yen, they said.     The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.     The dollar opened at 1.8245/50 marks against 1.8270/80 in New York. Sterling was unchanged from New York's 1.6175/85 dlr finish.     The market is generally sceptical about the outcome of any G-5 or G-7 meeting in Washington and the dollar is likely to come under selling pressure which could push it towards 140 yen if no significant measures to stabilise currencies emerge, dealers said.     They said Japan is expected to try to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability, but added they expect disagreement between Japan and other nations.     Japanese officials travelling with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Reuters the G-7 will meet today, but currency target zones or reference ranges will not be discussed.     The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, when a medium-sized trading house started to sell the dollar, dealers said.     The dollar opened at 1.5140/47 Swiss francs against 1.5145/55 in New York.  REUTER &#3;
