TEXAS EASTERN <TET> PLEDGES PCB CLEANUP

Texas Eastern Corp's Texas Eastern Gas Pipleline unit President Howard C. Homeyer said the company is committed to cleaning up polychlorinated biphyenyls PCBs from its pipeline system.     In testimony before Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.), oversight committee on Environment and Public Works, a press statement said Homeyer said the company will work with the Environmental Protection Agency to immediately clean up contaminated sites.     The New York Times today reported that the EPA knew as early as the fall of 1985 about PCB contamination at sites along the Texas Eastern pipeline, but took no action because the company supplied insufficient information.     According to the Times, Texas Eastern admitted burying PCBs at 51 sites along its right of way.     Homeyer told the committee, according to a statement, that the cleanup will require cooperation among EPA headquarters, six EPA regions and a dozen states to avoid delays.     Texas Eastern officials were not immediately available for comment.  Reuter &#3;
