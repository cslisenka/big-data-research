U.S. TREASURY TO MODIFY TRANSFERS PROGRAM

The Treasury said it was modifying its computerized Coupons Under Book-Entry Safekeeping (CUBES) program by permitting on-line transfers of funds against payment by deposit-taking institutions.     Each institution will be able to keep a CUBES account at its local Federal Reserve Bank or a branch and through it handle trading nationwide, a Treasury release said.     The new system is expected to be in operation late this year.     Currently, CUBES accounts are maintained off-line at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Treasury said.  Reuter &#3;
