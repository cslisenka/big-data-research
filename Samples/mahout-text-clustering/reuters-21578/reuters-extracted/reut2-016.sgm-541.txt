IRAN SAYS IT ACHIEVED OBJECTIVE IN BASRA OFFENSIVE

Iran said it had achieved its objectives in heavy fighting against Iraq since launching an offensive near the southern Iraqi city of Basra last Tuesday.     Baghdad said on Saturday its forces had routed the Iranians from the few footholds they initially gained. But an Iranian field commander said on Sunday the Iranians are now entrenched west of the Jasim River and the Fish canal, about 10 km east of Basra.     The unnamed commander, quoted by the Iranian news agency IRNA, said foreign reporters could now visit Iranian strongholds in the region.  REUTER &#3;
