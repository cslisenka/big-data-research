KYOWA BANK SHORT-TERM RATES UPGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it raised short-term ratings to A-1-plus from A-1 of Kyowa Bank Ltd.     S and P cited a steady progress in all major areas of operation over the past few years. The upward trend in profitability partly reflects decreased operating expenses as interest margins have been historically strong, S and P added.     It said Kyowa's capital ratios compare favorably with domestic and international banking peers when some credit is given for a substantial level of hidden reserves. Management appears capable of taking necessary steps to cope with financial deregulation of the domestic market, S and P added.  Reuter &#3;
