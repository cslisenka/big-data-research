ST. GERMAIN REGRETS VOLCKER STEPPING DOWN

House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St. Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat, said he regretted Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker had decided not to accept a new term.     "Paul Volcker has been an island of strength and stability," St. Germain said in a statement.     "I deeply regret his decision," he added. "This nation has been extremely fortunate in having giants on the scene during times of crisis. Thank God, Paul Volcker was available during this period of domestic and world economic turmoil," St. Germain said.  Reuter &#3;
