MONTENAY POWER TO OPERATE DADE COUNTY WASTE UNIT

<Montenay Power Corp> said it reached final agreement on a 15-year-contract for operation of the Dade County Resources Recovery Facility, the largest plant of its type in the world.     The company is part of Montenay S.A, a subsidiary of <Compagnie Generale des Ezux> of France.     It said county commissions ratified the contract which calls for investment of 45 mln dlrs to refurbish the plant and restore it to its original capacity of 920,000 tons of solid waste per year.         Montenay said the agreement allows Dade County to maintain its disposal fee at 27 dlrs per ton, by far the lowest of all counties involved in resource recovery in Florida.     The company said it will receive 22 dlrs per ton of refuse processed, split revenues from electricty sold to FPL Group Inc's <FPL> Florida Power and Light Co subsidiary with the county and retain revenues from the sale of ash, minerals and other recycled materials.     Montenay said the contract extends through 2002 its operation of the plant, which began in 1985 when the company took over the plant from the previous owners.  Reuter &#3;
