LME COPPER CLOSES AFTER RETREAT FROM EARLIER HIGHS

LME afternoon ring dealings in copper ended with three months Grade A business at 879 stg per tonne, a rise of three from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1,410 dlrs per tonne, up four.     However, values were off the day's highs, reflecting the softer tone on Comex, while the cash to three months premium narrowed to 32 stg in the absence of followthrough to earlier nearby buying, traders said. The breakdown of the spread premium equated to 20, seven and five stg for the first, second and third months, respectively. Standard metal finished with an indicated backwardation of around two stg.     Morning ring dealings ended with forward business at a high of 883 stg per tonne, equivalent to 1,417 dlrs. Business featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32, unchanged from yesterday afternoon, traders said.     Forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency factors, with short covering and some chart support evident.     Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation of 23 stg.     Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a minor chart support base, although upside potential remains limited against a background of only routine physical demand and a buoyant U.K. Currency.     On the morning pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based and within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders said.     Standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg but was tradeless.  REUTER &#3;
