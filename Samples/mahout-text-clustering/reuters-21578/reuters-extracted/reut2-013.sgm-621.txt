STRONG QUAKE JOLTS CENTRAL JAPAN

A strong earthquake registering 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted central and northern Japan, the Meteorological Agency said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.     An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake, which struck at 0940 hrs (0040 GMT), as being under the sea off Fukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo.     On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richter scale hit southwest Japan, killing two people.     Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.     The agency issued, but soon cancelled, a tidal-wave warning for the Pacific coastline of central and northern Japan.     The Shinkansen bullet train linking Tokyo and northern Morioka stopped running. Services will be suspended for several hours while workers check the tracks, railway officials told Reuters.     A spokesman for Fukushima police told Reuters they had not received any damage reports, even from the coastal town of Onahama, which registered the maximum intensity.     He described the shaking as very strong.  Reuter &#3;
