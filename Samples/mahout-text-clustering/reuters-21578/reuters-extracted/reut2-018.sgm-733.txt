DONORS PLEDGE 3.15 BILLION DLRS INDONESIAN AID

Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.     The funds compare with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last year's meeting and exceed the World Bank's recommendation for the coming year, the statement said.     "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," it said.     The statement said Indonesia must take further steps toward economic growth to create employment and called for policies supporting growth of agriculture.  Reuter &#3;
