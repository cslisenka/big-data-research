LONDON COFFEE FUTURES QUIETLY FIRMER AT MIDDAY

Robusta futures firmed at midday in extremely quiet trading, ranging three to 12 stg per tonne higher at the end of the morning call. Second position July rose seven stg to 1,258 stg.     As the recent increase in roaster demand seems to have quieted today, dealers attributed the market's steadiness to a technical consolidation of the decline in the past few weeks. London futures appeared to be following New York coffee, which has stabilized just above 1.00 dlr, some dealers said.     Physicals were quiet, with significant origin offers and roaster enquiry absent. Volume was 1,110 lots with 520 crosses.  REUTER &#3;
