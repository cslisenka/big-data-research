THREE SUED OVER BALL VALVES FOR NINE MILE POINT

Niagara Mohawk Power Corp said it and the other owners of Nine Mile Point Two nuclear power unit have filed suit seeking over 500 mln dlrs in damages against three companies involved with the design and fabrication of the ball valve system for the plant.     The company said the suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, names Gulf and Western Industries Inc <GW>, Wickes Cos Inc <WIX>'s Wickes Manufacturing Co Inc subsidiary and Gearhart Industries Inc's <GOI> Crosby Valve and Gage Co affiliate.     Gulf and Western sold the Fluid Systems Division of its Gulf and Western Manufacturing unit, which makes such valves, to Crosby Valve in 1983 and the remainder of Gulf and Western Manufacturing to Wickes in 1985.     The company said the suit alleges breaches of contract and warranty and negligence in engineering and seeks damages for the cost of delay in the plant's commercial operation alleged caused by the failure of the valve system to meet contract specifications and licensing requirements.     The ball-type main steam isolation valve system was removed from Nine Mile Two in March following tests in which the company said the valves failed to meet specifications agreed to by the defendants. The system is now being replaced by a Y-pattern globe valve system.     It said the 500 mln dlr figure is a preliminary estimate.     Niagara Mohawk owns 41 pct of Nine Mile Two, a 1,080 megatt boiling water reactor near Oswego, N.Y., with Long Island Lighting Co <LIL> owning 18 pct, Rochester Gas and Electric Corp <RGS> 14 pct and Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp <CNH> nine pct.
