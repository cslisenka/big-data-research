H.K.'S KOWLOON-CANTON RAILWAY PLANS NEW LINE

The government-owned <Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp> is planning a new line to link up the existing railroad with the new light rail system now under construction, a company spokeswoman said.     She said the 14.9-kilometre link will connect the two independent lines in the northern part of the suburban area near the China border. It is not yet decided whether a light rail system or a conventional system will be used for the link.     The link, which will take about 3-1/2 years to complete, is expected to cost 1.26 billion H.K. Dlrs, she said.     The spokeswoman said the final decision on the link is up to the government, depending on the government's overall transport and development policy.     She said consultancy studies commissioned by the company show that by 1996 the new link will carry 137,100 passengers daily and generate an additional 50,000 passengers in the conventional railway system.
