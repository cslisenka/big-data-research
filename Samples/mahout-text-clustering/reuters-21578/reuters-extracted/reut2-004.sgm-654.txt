TAIWAN ENIVIRONMENTAL PROTESTS BLOCK DU PONT PLANT

The U.S. Company Du Pont De Nemours <DD> has abandoned plans to build a chemical factory near the west coast port of Lukang after environmental protests.     A company spokesman told a news conference yesterday that Du Pont would conduct an environmental impact study and then look for another site for the 160 mln U.S. Dlr titanium dioxide plant, the largest foreign investment project in Taiwan.     The decision came after almost a year of protests by residents who feared pollution from the plant might ruin the tourist industry and nearby fish farms.  REUTER &#3;
