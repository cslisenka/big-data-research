PORK BELLY FUTURES HIGHER AT MIDSESSION

Pork belly (bacon) futures fell for net losses after starting higher, but firmed again at midsession to post gains of 0.25 to 0.60 cent paced by February.     Strength in other meat pits, especially live hog futures, stimulated renewed local demand. Higher cash hog markets, light runs as farmers take to the fields and possibly light slaughter prompted support. Technical buying after yesterday's reversal action added to the advance, traders said.     Commission house profit-taking selling prompted by expectations of a negative out of town storage report this afternoon weighed on prices early. Guesses on the report ranged from in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs, they noted.  Reuter &#3;
