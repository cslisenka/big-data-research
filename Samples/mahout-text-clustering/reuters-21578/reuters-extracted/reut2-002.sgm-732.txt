SHULTZ, SHEVARDNADZE SAID TO MEET IN APRIL

Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnaze will meet in Moscow in mid-April, administration sources said.     The sources said they will meet April 13 to 16 and are expected to discuss the full range of U.S.-Soviet issues.     But arms control is expected to be the major focus of the talks, with a breakthrough widely expected on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe.  Reuter &#3;
