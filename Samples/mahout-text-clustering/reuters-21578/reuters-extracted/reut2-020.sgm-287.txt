SALOMON <SB> OFFERS FASTER MUTUAL FUND CLEARING

Salomon Inc said it offered to clear transactions faster than normal for its mutual fund clients.     Robert Salomon, managing director, in response to a question, would not say whether the firm has committed to lend capital to mutal funds as has Goldman Sachs and Co. Goldman said it would lend up to one billion dlrs to mutual funds to enable them to sell securities for cash if they need to do so.     "We are certainly working to meet the need of our clients," Salomon said. "We have offered the mutual fund industry to clear transactions faster than normal settlement if that accommodates their need," he said.  Reuter &#3;
