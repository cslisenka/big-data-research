U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE PROPOSES DEFENCE CUTS

The House Armed Services Committee last night proposed cutting President Reagan's funding request for the Strategic Defence Initiative program by 1.7 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion.     The committee also cut by more than half the amount the president requested for a rail system for strategic missiles. It approved 250 mln dlrs for the project during its consideration of the 1988 defence authorisation bill.     The committee's proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senate before becoming law. The administration's total request for 1988 defence spending was 312 billion dlrs.  REUTER &#3;
