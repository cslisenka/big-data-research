ITALIAN DISCOUNT CERTIFICATE ISSUE UNDERSUBSCRIBED

The Bank of Italy said market operators had taken up 1,111 billion lire of indexed government discount certificates (CTs) out of an offer of 2,500 billion lire.     The Bank took up 600 billion lire and 789 billion were unassigned.     The seven-year certificates carry a first-year coupon payable April 21 1988 of 4.86 pct, identical to that on the preceeding issue of CTs in March.     They were offered at a base price of 72 lire, down from 74 previously, for an effective annual yield on the first coupon of 10.15 pct against 9.66 in March. Yields after the first year will be linked to rates on 12-month Treasury bills. &#3;
