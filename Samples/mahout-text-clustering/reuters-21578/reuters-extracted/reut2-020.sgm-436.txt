FDIC'S SEIDMAN SAYS BANKS UNAFFECTED BY MARKET

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman Wiliam Seidman said the stock market decline has not had a measurable impact on U.S. banks.     Seidman, attending the American Bankers Association annual convention, told reporters, "We are looking to see if the stock market was having any direct effects. We have seen none."     Seidman also said that he was pleased at the decision by Chemical New York Corp <CHL> and others to lower their prime rate. He said he believed it was a response to the stock market behavior. "I think it's a good idea," he said.     Seidman said he believes the economy will remain strong as long as interest rates remain stable.     He said the Federal Reserve Board's announcement that it stood ready to provide liquidity to the financial system was an effort to reassure markets.     "In 1929, they did not provide it (liquidity) and now they are reassuring people that that will not happen again. I fully support it," he said.     He said that the stock market decline was not an argument against allowing banks to underwrite securities because the stock market is expected to fluctuate.  Reuter &#3;
