QUEBEC GOVERNMENT TO OFFER HELP TO NORANDA MINE

Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open (Noranda Inc)'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure until damage estimates have been completed.     Federal member of parliament for the region, Charles-Eugene Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about 10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more specific estimate by the end of the month.     Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access to the burned-out area.     Noranda said the mine was not insured.     "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all of Noranda's underground operations would have been prohibitive," Larry Taylor, Noranda's risk management and insurance director, said.     Taylor said before last week's fire, the company had only had one previous mine accident many years ago.     Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have started on a new conveyor system.     Noranda has said it would take four to five months to return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced 72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.  Reuter &#3;
