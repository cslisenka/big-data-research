ALLEGHENY INT'L <AG> BANKS EXTEND WAIVER

Allegheny International Inc said a consortium of banks which entered into long term and short term secured revolving credit agreements with the company last year has agreed to extend a previously granted waiver of certain financial net worth covenants to April 29 from March 18.     The company said last week it was seeking such a waiver.     AI is currently engaged in discussions with the consortium to extend the short term agreement beyond April 29 and expects such an extension will be obtained.  Reuter &#3;
