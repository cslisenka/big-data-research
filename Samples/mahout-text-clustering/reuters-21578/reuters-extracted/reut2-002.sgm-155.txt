WRIGHT SAYS TAX RISE NEEDED TO CUT U.S. DEFICIT

House Speaker James Wright said President Reagan should realize that there will be no way to meet the deficit reduction targets in the 1988 budget without a tax increase.     "In my judgment there isn't any way to achieve the commanded reductions in the deficit without some additional revenue," the Texas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the House session.     Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additional tax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs in additional revenues in the 1988 budget.     "It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it's a question of who has to pay," Wright said.     He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included in Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients, tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home purchases.     Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.     "There has to be a recognition of reality," he said.  Reuter &#3;
