U.S. SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES BUDGET

The Senate Budget Committee ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year.     The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11.     Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles added about 400 million dlrs for additional, unspecified, agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with higher user fees.
