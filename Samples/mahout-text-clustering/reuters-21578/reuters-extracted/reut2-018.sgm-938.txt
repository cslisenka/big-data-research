CHINA GETS WORLD BANK LOAN FOR FERTILIZER

The World Bank said it approved a 97.4 mln dlr loan for China to help boost fertilizer output in order to increase agricultural production.     The 20-year loan supports a project aimed at improving the efficiency of medium-scale fertilizer plants through technical renovations and energy conservation, the bank said.     It said the project also seeks to reduce agricultural nutrient imbalances by building the capacity for phosphate fertilizer production and to improve institutional efficiency by introducing modern economic, financial and operational systems and techniques.
