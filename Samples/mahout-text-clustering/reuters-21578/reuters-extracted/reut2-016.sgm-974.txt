SUGAR PLANTING IN WESTERN EUROPE, DELAY IN USSR

Dry, warm weather over Western Europe sugar beet areas this week will allow planting to progress rapidly, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.     Sugar beet areas in Britain will be dry and warm Thursday and Friday while beet areas from France to West Germany will have dry, seasonable weather, becoming warmer.     But damp, chilly weather will delay planting in all Soviet beet areas, it said. Eastern Soviet sugar beet areas were windy yesterday with rain and snow showers. Water equivalent amounts were 0.10 of an inch.     Showers or snow flurries will linger today and up to 0.30 of an inch of rain is likely tomorrow.  Reuter &#3;
