ALLIED-SIGNAL <ALD> UNIT TO CUT EMPLOYEES

Allied-Signal Inc's Bendix Test Systems Division is cutting between 75 and 125 employes as part of its streamlining efforts.     Bendix, which is part of the Aircraft Systems Co of Allied-Signal's Aerospace's Bendix sector, said the cuts would create a more cost-effective unit. It said employment is expected to remain at approximately 1,200 employes.     The reductions began last month when the division announced a voluntary retirement program for eligible employes.
