CANADIAN BONDS SLIGHTLY OFF IN EARLY TRADE

Canadian bonds recouped some opening losses to trade unchanged to mildly lower in quiet, mostly uneventful early activity, dealers said.     The market opened 1/4 lower on weaker U.S. Credit markets, but later rebounded in tandem with American prices, which reacted to a firming U.S. Currency, the dealers noted. Many investors stayed sidelined, awaiting clearer economic signals.     The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 fell 1/8 to 106-1/4 1/2 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 was unchanged at 97-3/8 5/8.
