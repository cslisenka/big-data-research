IBM <IBM> NAMES NEW PRESIDENT FOR ROLM UNIT

International Business Machines Corp said IBM vice president Ray S. AbuZayyad has been named president of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D. Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.     The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has been named president of the IBM General Products Division, succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardo has been named president of IBM's General Technology Division, succeeding Low.     A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down for personal reasons.     His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move last month to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into its own marketing corps.     That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm's independence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing and product development site within IBM.     "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said, adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.     Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makes telephone exchanges and other communications equipment, since it was acquired by IBM in 1984.     Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more than a year ago.     Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack of coordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate the unit lost money last year.     But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the way things are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its best fourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter.  Reuter &#3;
