OMI <OMIC.O> PLANS TO REDUCE DEBT TO 30 MLN DLRS

Omi Corp said it expects to reduce the debt guaranteed by former parent Ogden Corp <OG> to 30 mln dlrs from about 50 mln dlrs by the end of 1987 from financing measures including an employee stock ownership plan.     The bulk shipping company said it expects to have the ESOP in place before year end, subject to stockholder approval.     The company also said it anticipates later this year to refinance its high cost debt related to a U.S. flag chemical tanker through a lease swap arrangement.     Omi said this move would further enhance cash flow.         In another matter, the company said through a joint venture with <Anders Wilhelmsen and Co>, three large crude carriers have been chartered-in for minimum periods of six months with various extension options, and, in one case, a purchase option.     The company said it anticipates that the purchase option will be exercised by the joint venture this summer.  Reuter &#3;
