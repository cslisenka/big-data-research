BOLIVIA TO PROPOSE ANDEAN SUMMIT WITH REAGAN

Bolivian president Victor Paz Estenssoro will propose to Andean Pact countries a summit meeting with U.S. President Reagan to take place in Venezuela in May, foreign minister Guillermo Bedregal announced.      He told reporters that the summit "if everything goes well" will possibly take place in one or two months.      "We are coordinating an eventual meeting of the Andean Pact presidents and President Reagan, which could take place in Venezuela in May", he said. The proposal is part of Bolivia's intention to relaunch the Andean Pact, he added.      The Andean Pact, formed by Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador, is a sub-regional economic group set up in 1969 to counteract economic progress of other more developed South American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil.
