AMR <AMR> DISCOUNTS TALK ON PAN AM <PN> DEAL

AMR Corp chairman Robert Crandall, denying industry speculation, said the company is not interested in acquiring shuttle routes in the northeast region of the U.S. from Pan Am Corp.     But in remarks at a press conference announcing a major aircraft order, he said AMR would be interested in certain other Pan Am assets. But he noted that none had been made available.     Pan Am earlier today announced an order for 40 new aircraft from Boeing Co <BA> and <Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, for an estimated 2.5 billion dlrs.     AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has said it is not interested in acquiring Pan Am as a whole and Crandall reiterated that position today.     "Assets are one thing, and companies are another," Crandall said, referring to the possibility of acquiring assets from Pan Am.     He said Pan Am has not offered its transatlantic routes for sale, adding that it would not make much sense for them to do so.    Reuter &#3;
