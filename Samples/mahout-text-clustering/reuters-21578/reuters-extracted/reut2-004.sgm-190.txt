CME CONTINUES DELIBERATION ON DUAL TRADING BAN

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) adjourned a meeting late last night without reaching a decision on a petition to ban dual trading in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures, an exchange official said.     CME president Bill Brodsky told Reuters that the CME board would meet again today and probably reach a decision either late today or tomorrow.     Dual trading involves the right of members to trade for their own account as well filling orders for customers.     The petition, signed by several hundred exchange members when it was circulated on the floor of the CME two weeks ago, calls for the elimination of dual trading in the S and P pit. Some industry watchers believe that if the CME eliminates the practice other exchanges will have to consider such a move.     The practice has drawn criticism from some sectors in that it provides an opportunity for abusive practices in which customer orders are not executed at the best possible price.     One practice, know as "front-running," involves a broker trading ahead of a large customer order and then profiting by the impact on the market of the customer order.  Reuter &#3;
