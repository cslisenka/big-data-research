LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS

Reducing the amount of crop base a farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year 1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.     The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up, but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.     Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.     Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.     Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400 to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year 1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.     Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill.     Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments, implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the use of generic in-kind certificates.
