CRIBB NAMED REAGAN'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS ADVISER

President Reagan, moving to add a prominent conservative to his top White House management team, named Kenneth Cribb to be his domestic affairs adviser.     Cribb, a former counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese, has served on the transition team assembled by new White House chief of staff Howard Baker since early March.     Baker, who replaced Donald Regan as the president's top aide, is considered a moderate Republican as is his deputy, Kenneth Duberstein.     Reagan also announced that Edwin Feulner, another leading conservative activist, would serve as a consultant to the White House. However, Feulner will remain president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank.      REUTER &#3;
