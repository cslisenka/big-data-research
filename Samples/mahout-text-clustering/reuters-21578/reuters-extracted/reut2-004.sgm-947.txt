FORMER SANTA FE EXEC ADMITS INSIDER TRADING

Darius N. Keaton, former member of the board of <Santa Fe International Corp>, pleaded guilty to an insider trading scheme that netted him 274,800 dlrs in profit.     In Manhattan Federal Court, Keaton pleaded guilty to trading on non-public information involving his purchase of 10,000 shares of the company's stock in September 1981 shortly before the company was acquired by Kuwait Petroleum Co in 1982 for two billion dlrs.     Keaton, 62, of Monterey, Calif., admitted he failed to report the purchase to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and admitted commiting wire fraud stemming from his transaction.     He faces up to 10 years in prison on both counts, and a fine of 11,000 dlrs when he is sentenced by Judge Whitman Knapp on June 1.  Reuter &#3;
