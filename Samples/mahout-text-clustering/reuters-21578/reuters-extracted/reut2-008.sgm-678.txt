BOMB EXPLODES AT BRITISH ARMY BASE, 30 INJURED

A huge car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine last night, injuring about 30 people just hours after British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher left the West German capital.     A British Army spokeswoman said today that seven people were still being treated for minor injuries in hospitals in the Moenchengladbach area, near the Rheindahlen base, after being being hit by flying shards of glass from the blast.     The 100-kg bomb went off outside an officers' mess at 10.30 P.M. (2130 GMT), ripping a crater half a meter (1.5 feet) deep and three meters (nine feet) wide in the ground, and could be heard several kilometers (miles) away, a police spokesman said.     An anonymous caller, speaking English, telephoned the West German domestic news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur just before the explosion and said a bomb was about to go off at the base.     Thatcher left Bonn early yesterday evening after talks with with Chancellor Helmut Kohl ahead of her visit to Moscow next week. She had flown to West Germany from talks with French President Francois Mitterrand in Normandy earlier in the day.     Officers of the Nato Northern Army Group, which is also based at Rheindahlen, were holding a social dinner attended by British and West German servicemen and their wives inside the mess when the bomb went off.
