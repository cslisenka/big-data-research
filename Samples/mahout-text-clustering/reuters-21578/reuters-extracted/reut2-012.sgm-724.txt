RESCUE WORKERS BRINGING MINERS FROM UNDERGROUND

Rescue workers are bringing out miners who have been trapped in a <Noranda Inc> copper mine for almost 24 hours by fire which has so far killed one and sent 17 to hospital, company officials said.     "We're working to take the men out - everybody that's underground is safe, we're established contact with them and now it's really just finding out how to take them out," Andre Fortier, a vice president with Noranda Minerals, which owns the mine said.     Ange-Aime Kenny died after being trapped by smoke from the fire, company officials said. Fortier said he believed all the workers would be rescued by the end of the night. He said he did not believe any of the 17 men taken to hospital were seriously injured.  Reuter &#3;
