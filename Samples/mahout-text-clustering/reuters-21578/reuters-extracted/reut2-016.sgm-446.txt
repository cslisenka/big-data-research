USG <USG> TO ASK INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED SHARES

USG Corp in a proxy for its May 13 annual meeting said it will ask shareholders to increase the authorized common shares to 300 mln from 100 mln and the preferred shares to 36 mln from 12 mln.     The company said it there were insufficient shares available for a two-for-one stock split, although it said there were no plans to take such action.     It said the availability of additional shares could discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company. But USG said it is unaware of any pending takeover attempt.     As of April 1, 1987, USG said there were 51,128,191 shares of its common stock outstanding. It said 784,350 shares were reserved for issuance under various stock option plans.     Of the 12 mln authorized shares of preferred stock, it said 124,641 shares of 1.80 dlrs Convertible Preferred Stock was issued and outstanding and an additional 6,800,000 shares were reserved for issuance as Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A, 1.00 dlr par value a share.     USG also said shareholders will be asked to approve an amendment to its restated certificate of incorporation that includes staggered election of directors and the requirement of an 80 pct vote on certain mergers and asset sales or leases.     The company also is asking shareholders to approve an amendment limiting the liability of directors.  Reuter &#3;
