PORSCHE RECALLS 892 OF ITS 1987 MODEL CARS

Porsche Cars North America Inc said it will recall 892 Porsche 928S-4 model vehicles to replace possibly defective fuel return hoses.     It said the recall involves only 1987 model year vehicles.     Porsche said the cars involved may have been fitted with fuel return hoses which are not sufficiently resistant to damage by exposure to atmospheric ozone.  Reuter &#3;
