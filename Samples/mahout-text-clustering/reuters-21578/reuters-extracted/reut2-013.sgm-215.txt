U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER FROM JANUARY BLAHS

Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels of 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully rebounded from its January slump.     Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.     For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.     "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham Lambert.     "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latest figures build on that. This lends some encouragement to the idea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.     In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on an annual basis, before dropping again.     Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to take advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from normal January selling.     But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market and a growing array of incentives have lured customers to dealers' showrooms, analysts said.    Ford Motor Co <F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to 79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's second largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to 197,328 compared to 167,490.     Chrysler Corp <C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454 compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3 pct from 90,945.     Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest 6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. But sales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from 370,390.     Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the slackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales decline in memory.     "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a phenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis at Morgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so they've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."     General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2 pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year and far below the 56 pct of most of last year.     Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the first three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise from 13.7 pct since the start of the year.     Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted the company to decide this week to close six plants for a week to bring supply into line with demand.     But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further production cuts might be necessary.     "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter production already because of weak sales, the continuation of this weakening market share suggests another production cutback is likely," Glantz said.     Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during the March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp <AMC> 1,198, down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda 16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.
