DANISH SUGAR BEET PLANTING BEHIND SCHEDULE

Sugar beet planting in Denmark is about two weeks behind normal due to a severe winter and a wet spring, a spokesman for the country's largest sugar beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said.     The weather has improved recently but very little beet has been drilled so far.     "If good weather conditions continue, I think we will be sowing next week or the following week," the spokesman said.  Reuter &#3;
