GROWTH VENTURES <GVENC> DROPS UNITS

Growth Ventures Inc said it is discontinuing its participation in a Mexican joint venture formed to make flexible diskettes and is liquidating its wholly-owned Rock Hohl Interiors Inc subsidiary in Colorado Springs, Colo.     The company said the resulting losses, lack of assets and negative net worth will in all likelihood make it impossible for Groweth Ventures to continue operating.     The company said it is ending its participation in the Mexican venture due to continuing delays in obtaining sufficient working capital funding from government-controlled banks in Mexico.  The funding is needed not only for joint venture operations but also for the payment on debentures to Growth Ventures from the joint venture, it said.     It said since payment on the debentures has not been made, it does not have sufficient capital to support the continuing operations of Rick Hohl Interiors, and it will liquidate Rick Hohl.
