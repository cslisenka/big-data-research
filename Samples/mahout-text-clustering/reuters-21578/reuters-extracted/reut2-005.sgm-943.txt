BAKER URGES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT BANKS

Treasury Secretary James Baker urged Congress to support the administration's financing requests for the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal years.     Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal 1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill Washington's annual payment responsibilities.     In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago, Baker said support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership.     Baker told the committee, "Our national self respect and our international leadership depend on our willingness to fulfill this responsibility."     The administration budget requests include a supplemental request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr request for fiscal 1988.     Baker noted these requests included funding requirements negotiated by the administration with this committee.     Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them.     Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in others aimed at making them more efficient, with policies oriented toward free markets.     He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in resolving the debt crisis.     In other remarks, Baker repeated the need to finance the general foreign affairs budget and underscored how MDBs have served U.S. national interests.  Reuter &#3;
