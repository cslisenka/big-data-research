GENERAL HYDROCARBONS DISTRIBUTION DELAYED

General Hydrocarbons Inc said claims aggregating over one mln dlrs related to liens and alleging title deficiencies have been made against the escrow fund holding its assets for distribution.     It said the record date for the distribution will be delayed until the claims are resolved.     The company said it believes many of the claims are overstated or without merit. It said the resolution may not occur before April 30.     General Hydrocarbons' assets now consist of cash and Montana Power Co <MTP> shares.  Reuter &#3;
