ROSTENKOWSKI QUERIES IDEA OF U.S. SECURITIES TAX

House Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he questioned whether a U.S. tax on securities transactions would be appropriate.     The Illinois Democrat told Reuters before addressing the Future Industry Association that such a tax may impair the international competitiveness of the U.S. securities business. House Speaker James Wright has said a tax on securities transactions could help reduce the federal deficit.     Rostenkowski said he understood that the U.K. is exploring the possibility of easing its tax burden on securities firms. Thus, a new U.S. tax would be especially hard felt here.  Reuter &#3;
