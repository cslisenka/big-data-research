DAYTON HUDSON <DH> SELLS 9-7/8 PCT DEBENTURES

Dayton Hudson Corp is raising 150 mln dlrs through an offering of sinking fund debentures due 2017 with a 9-7/8 pct coupon and par pricing, said lead manager Goldman, Sachs and Co.     That is 129 basis points over the yield of comparable Treasury securities.     The issue is non-refundable for 10 years. A sinking fund starting in 1998 can be increased by 200 pct at the company's option, giving them an estimated minimum life of 13.85 years and maximum life of 20.5 years. Moody's rates the debt Aa-3 and Standard and Poor's rates it AA.                                                  Reuter &#3;
