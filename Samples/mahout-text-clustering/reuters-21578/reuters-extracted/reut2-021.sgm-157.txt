SWISS PLAN CHANGE IN LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT

The Swiss Banking Commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual liquidity requirements.     Commission Director Kurt Hauri told Reuters the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month.     By effectively reducing liquidity requirements, it would also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain, West Germany and the United States, he said.     The commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements, where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole.     The current system, described  as a Swiss special case by Hauri, forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month.     The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates, overshadowed by the approach of the end-month, called the ultimo, with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank.     This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures, due to a combination of the half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its money supply target. Although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility, the problem remained.     The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned for years, was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on September 30.     They have until the end of this month to suggest alterations. Subject to such changes, and to the government go-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said.  REUTER &#3;
