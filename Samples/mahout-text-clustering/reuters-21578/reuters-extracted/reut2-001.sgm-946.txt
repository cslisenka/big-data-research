BANK OF CEYLON TO ADOPT NEW POLICIES

Sri Lanka's largest bank, the government-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a more aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess liquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge the country's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairman Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview.     The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to be announced later, he said.     Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of Ceylon, the nation's central bank, until January.     A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratne declined to identify, has agreed in principal to guarantee export credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further.     The bank may also consider more actively participating in the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees, or about 70 pct of the total market, he said.     Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.     The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in MBSL, Sandaratne said.     He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions for bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln allotted for general provisions, he added.  REUTER &#3;
