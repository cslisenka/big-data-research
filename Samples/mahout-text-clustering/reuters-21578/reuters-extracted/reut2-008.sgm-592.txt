HAIG SAYS HE PLANS TO RUN FOR U.S. PRESIDENT

Former U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig has announced his intention to run for president.     Haig, a former general and NATO chief who served seven presidents but never held elected office, said he will formally announce his bid to run for the Republican presidential nomination at a news conference later today.     Haig's aides say he starts far back in the field of Republican hopefuls, which is currently dominated by Vice-President George Bush and Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, neither of whom have yet declared their intentions.
