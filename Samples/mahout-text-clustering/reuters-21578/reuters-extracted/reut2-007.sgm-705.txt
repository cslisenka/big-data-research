TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS TAX CHEATING UNDETECTED

Treasury Secretary James Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there is still lots of room for improvement in government programs to crack down on tax cheating.     "I think we're far from the point at which we reach saturation," Baker said when asked at what point additional efforts to catch cheating become fruitless.     He said Internal Revenue Service efforts would raise a projected 41 billion dlrs in fiscal 1988 compared to 18 billion dlrs in 1981.     "So we are increasing," Baker said.  Reuter &#3;
