VW FOREIGN EXCHANGE INQUIRIES FOCUS ON WOLFSBURG

West German state prosecutors have focussed their inquiries in the suspected foreign exchange fraud reported by Volkswagen <VOWG.F> on Wolfsburg, the company's headquarters, the state prosecutor's office said here.     Chief state prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters his office would focus its attention on Wolfsburg, and not Frankfurt as newspaper reports suggested over the weekend.     "We asked Frankfurt prosecutors to assist us in our investigations but their findings led us to believe that we have to concentrate on Wolfsburg," Retemeyer said.     The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said yesterday the state prosecutors investigation was now focusing on possible outside banking accomplices.     The company's reported loss of 480 mln marks in currency transactions aimed at hedging against fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar has produced a shake-up among senior staff. VW announced over the weekend that Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board, had resigned.     Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, president of the West German Federation of Banks, said today that no member bank was involved in activities which led to the currency loss.  Reuter &#3;
