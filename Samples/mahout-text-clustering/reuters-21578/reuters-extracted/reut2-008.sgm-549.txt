INLAND <IAD>, NIPPON FORM JOINT STEEL VENTURE

Inland Steel Industries said it has formed a joint venture with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp to build and operate a cold-rolled steel products plant costing more than 400 mln dlrs.     The joint venture, I/N Tek, will be 60 pct owned by Inland and 40 pct owned by Nippon, it said.     The plant, scheduled for completion in 1990, will feature a continuous-process configuration designed to cut normal production times, to improve product quality and to lower manufacturing cost of cold-rolled sheet steel, it said.     Inland Chairman Frank Luerssen said Inland and Nippon will provide 150 mln dlrs of the venture's "off balance sheet" financing, with Inland providing 90 mln dlrs and Nippon 60 mln dlrs.     The balance, he said, will come from <Mitsui and Co Ltd>, <Mitsubishi Corp> and <Nissho Iwai Corp>, three Japanese trading firms.     Luerssen said the plant will be located in South Bend, Ind., close to its product's automotive, appliance and office furniture markets, and near its source of raw materials, Inland's Indiana Harbor Works hot rolled steel plant.
