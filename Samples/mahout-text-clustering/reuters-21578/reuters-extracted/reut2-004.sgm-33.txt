ECUADOR DEBT TO BE HONOURED AFTER QUAKE SURVIVAL

Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake, will honour its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt but only after ensuring the survival of the country after the tremor which claimed at least 300 lives and caused 4,000 persons to disappear.     "The government's position ... is to permit us to honour the (debt) commitments but without sacrificing the country, because first we have to survive and later we can comply," information minister Marco Lara told reuters.      He said the nation would later announce definitive measures on the foreign debt in the aftermath of the earthquake which the government said will cause nearly a billion dlrs in economic losses.
