GERMAN OFFICIALS HAVE NO COMMENT ON BAKER REMARK

West German officials said they could make no comment on remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker who said Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers had agreed a new process for economic coordination.     At last year's G-7 summit in Tokyo, senior government officials were requested to make a study of how economic data could be better coordinated and the results of their work will be presented at next week's summit in Venice.     West Germany has said governments should not be obliged to take economic steps purely in reaction to economic data.     The U.S. Position on data coordination has been that governments should react accordingly when economic indicators fall short of expectations.     The West German stance on coordination of data, which has also been shared by the British government, has been a potential threat to a joint stance by the G-7 on this topic.     At a news conference in Washington, Baker would not be specific about what agreement had been reached on data coordination by the seven finance ministers.  REUTER &#3;
