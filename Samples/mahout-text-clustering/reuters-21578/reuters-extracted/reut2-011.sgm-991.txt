HOWARD BAKER AIDE EXPECTED TO GET TOP JOB

The White House is expected today to name Thomas Griscom, a longtime aide to chief of staff Howard Baker, as President Reagan's communications director.     Officials said an announcement was expected to be made during Reagan's trip to Philadelphia where the president is to make a speech to a group of doctors on the deadly disease AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).     Griscom, 37, was brought into the White House by former Senator Baker to help with the transition after Baker was named chief of staff following the resignation of Donald Regan in the wake of the Iran arms scandal.     He will take the job vacated by Patrick Buchanan, a high-profile conservative, who served two years as communications director.  Reuter &#3;
