U.S. SAYS NUCLEAR TEST BLEW DEBRIS OUTSIDE USSR

The United States charged that a Soviet nuclear test last month blew radioactive debris outside the Soviet Union in violation of a test ban treaty.     The State Department, which made the charge in a statement, gave no details of where the debris had landed or what level of radioactivity had been measured. It said Moscow had been told of U.S. concern over the incident.     U.S. officials refused to give details of the fall-out,  saying it would reveal how the intelligence had been gathered.     The Soviet test took place near the Siberia, Kazakhstan boarder, according to Swedish monitors.  REUTER &#3;
