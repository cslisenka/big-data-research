SEVEN KILLED IN BLACK SOUTH AFRICAN TOWNSHIP

Seven black youths were knifed and shot to death today in a mass killing in the South African township of KwaMashu near the Indian Ocean city of Durban, the government reported.     The Bureau for Information said the bodies of the youths, aged from 15 to 17, were found lying together. "It looks like a mass execution," a spokesman said.     Local residents said tensions have been high in the teeming township since Thursday with periodic clashes between black radicals and supporters of the conservative Inkatha movement.     The bureau spokesman said the bodies, with knife and bullet wounds, were discovered this morning. No other details were immediately available, he added.  Reuter &#3;
