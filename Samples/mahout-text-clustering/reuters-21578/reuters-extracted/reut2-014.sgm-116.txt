N.Y. COTTON FUTURES STEADY IN EARLY TRADING

Cotton futures were steady this morning on commission house buying. But trade selling was keeping gains to a minimum, brokers said.     There was no news, but brokers said the market is  technically weak and in search of a bottom. Recent news of poor export sales remained a damper, brokers said.     Cotton for May delivery was up 0.25 cent at 56.05 cents a lb in a 56.30 to 55.80 cent range.     December delivery was up 0.40 cent at 55.15 cents.  Reuter &#3;
