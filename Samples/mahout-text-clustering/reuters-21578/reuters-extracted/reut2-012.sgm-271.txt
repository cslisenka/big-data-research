HYDRO-QUEBEC HEARINGS TO REOPEN IN OTTAWA

The National Energy Board said hearings into Hydro-Quebec's request to sell power to the United States will reopen in Ottawa April nine.     The board heard nine days of testimony in Montreal after it opened the hearings March 16.     Hydro-Quebec is seeking an export license to sell 70 terawatt hours of electricity to the New England Power Pool, a group of about 90 utilities, from the year 1990 to 2000. The contract is valued at three billion Canadian dlrs. A terawatt hour is the power consumed by a city of 100,000 people in one year, or 70 billion kilowatt hours.     The hearings are scheduled to last two days in Ottawa.     After that, the board will begin its deliberations, which could take as long as two months before a decision is reached.  Reuter &#3;
