JAPAN SAYS IT IS DISAPPOINTED WITH TARIFFS

The Japanese Embassy said in a statement it was "deeply disappointed" by the tariffs announced by President Reagan in retaliation for Japan's not honoring its semiconductor agreement with the United States.     It said Japan had been fully implementing the pact to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods and the results were starting to show.     The embassy said Japan would complain to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as it said it would, and seek new talks with Washington to resolve the issue as soon as possible.  Reuter &#3;
