KIECHLE SEES POSITIVE ASPECTS IN EC MILK ACCORD

West German Farm Minister Ignaz Kiechle, who objected strongly to this week's European Community agreement to cut milk surpluses, conceded the accord would have the positive effect of stabilizing prices.     According to the text of a speech made in the town of Trudering, near Munich, Kiechle said farmers' earnings would benefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected the agreement because he preferred there to be no change in the EC's system of intervention. However, an objective analysis of the accord showed it contained positive elements, he said.     No formal vote was taken on the EC accord, but a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said Kiechle had made it clear in discussions in Brussels that he did not accept it. Ireland and Luxembourg were also opposed.  Reuter &#3;
