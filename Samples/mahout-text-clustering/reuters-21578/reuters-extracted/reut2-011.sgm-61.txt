U.S. GROUP ASKS SPECIAL ROYAL DUTCH<RD> MEETING

A group of U.S. investors opposed to Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum Co's South African policies plans to seek a special shareholders meeting to discuss their complaints.     Representatives of the American Baptist Churches and the New York City Teachers Retirement System said the company has refused to include their proposals in proxy material prepared for the annual meeting in May.     The group said its proposals call for an end to sales by Royal Dutch to the South African police and military and withdrawal from South Africa.     Reuter &#3;
