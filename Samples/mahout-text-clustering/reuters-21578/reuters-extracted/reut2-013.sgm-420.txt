DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN QUIET ZURICH

The dollar opened slightly lower in quiet trading, with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this week's top-level international monetary talks in Washington.     The dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 Swiss francs, down from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs in New York.     However, dealers were sceptical that anything other than a mere reaffirmation of February's Paris Accord was likely to emerge from Washington. "The dollar is likely to stay stable or drift slowly down," predicted one dealer at a major U.S. Bank.     The Swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other major currencies.     Sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs, down from the previous 2.4547/4578 francs close, while the mark slipped to 83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes.     The French franc opened at 24.97/25.00 centimes from the previous 24.98/25.02 centimes close.  REUTER &#3;
