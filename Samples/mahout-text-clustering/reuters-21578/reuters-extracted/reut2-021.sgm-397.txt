CMS <CMS> CITES HIGHER ELECTRIC SALES

CMS Energy Corp, parent of Consumers Power Co, said the fivefold improvement in its third quarter earnings was the result of higher electric sales.     The company also cited its ongoing refinancing program which it said significantly reduced high-cost debt and preference stock, and capitalized interest on assets which will be used in the company's Midland cogeneration venture.     CMS reported quarterly earnings of 56.0 mln dlrs, or 65 cts a share, up from 8.8 mln dlrs, or 10 cts a share a year earlier. It said electric sales were up 4.6 pct due to continued economic growth and warmer than normal weather.  Reuter &#3;
