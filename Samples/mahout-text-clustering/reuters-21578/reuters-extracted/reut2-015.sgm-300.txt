REAGAN TO ALLOW REVIEW OF HIS NOTES ON IRAN

President Reagan has agreed to let the House and Senate select committees investigating the Iran arms sale review his personal diary notes on the affair, committee members said today.     The notes will cover the period from January 1, 1984 to  December 19, 1986 when the Iran arms deal was planned and carried out and will include notes on Iran, Nicaragua and related subjects, House committee chairman Lee Hamilton said.     The notes will be selected by the White House counsel and reviewed by Reagan before they are made available to committee members within a few weeks.     Under terms of the agreement, committee members will be allowed to review the notes at the White House, but will not be permitted to make copies of the information.      Reuter &#3;
