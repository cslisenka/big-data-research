U.S. COULD APPROVE EGYPTIAN M-1A TANK PRODUCTION

The U.S. Defense Department said it has given preliminary approval for Egypt to produce the M-1A tank, the main battle tank of the United States.     The State and Defense Departments said talks were going on between the two countries dealing with Egypt's ability to build the tank and protect its high technology secrets.     The U.S. Army signed a contract four weeks ago to pay General Dynamics Corp <GD> 3.5 billion dlrs over the next four years to build 3,299 of the tanks.     Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters Congress probably will not be officially notified of any final plan until after October 1. Congress would then have 30 days to veto Egypt as the first foreign co-producer of the M-1A.     U.S. defense officials said Congress could approve the plan because Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace treaty with Israel. But they said the issues of technology transfer and a possible loss of U.S. jobs could raise problems for the plan while Israel would also be expected to lobby against any production agreement.
