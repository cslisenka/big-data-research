WORLD BANK OFFICIAL CALLS FOR BANKER FLEXIBILITY

World Bank Vice-President David Knox said creditor banks must become more flexible in providing funds for Latin American debtor nations.     "The international creditor banks must make their position more flexible, ensuring a flow of funds for Latin American countries, especially the most indebted," Knox told the semi- official newsagency Telam.     Knox said Brazil's decision last month to suspend payments on a large portion of its foreign debt had shocked the creditor banks. The banks were "in no hurry to provide funds for the debtor nations," he said.     But he said the situation of debtor nations transferring funds to the developed should be reversed. "It must be the other way round, to make development in indebted states possible."     He said the World Bank was supplying special lines of credit to make up for this inflexibility on the part of the banks. It had increased its involvement in development projects by 60 pct in the last two years, he said.     Knox said banks would grant Argentina loans of up to two billion dlrs over the next two years to help the country meet growth targets. Argentina is currently negotiating a 2.15 billion dlr loan with creditor banks for 1987.  REUTER &#3;
