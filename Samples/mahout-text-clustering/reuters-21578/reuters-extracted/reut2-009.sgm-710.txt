SINGAPORE RULE CHANGES SEEN HAVING LITTLE IMPACT

Revisions to the by-laws of the Stock Exchange of Singapore to be introduced on April 1 will have little impact on the market, brokers and analysts said.     One analyst did say, however, that the removal of fixed commissions on transactions in government securities and Asian currency bonds would increase trading volume, because most deals before were transacted directly between clients.     One change will allow stockbroking firms to advertise, but brokers said this would not have much effect because most corporate clients already know the market well.     Many remisiers (brokers' agents) and dealers criticised the exchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cut transfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.     One remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficient broking system because they restrict brokers' movements.     But most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cash deposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. Where an extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cash or in securities approved by the exchange.     Other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report all transactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange was unnecessary.     Another revision says broking firms are not allowed to improve a buying and selling quote by more than one bid during the last five minutes of trading.  REUTER &#3;
