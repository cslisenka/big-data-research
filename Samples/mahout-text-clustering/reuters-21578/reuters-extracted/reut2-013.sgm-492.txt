LONDON SUGAR FALLS TO SESSION LOWS BY MIDMORNING

Raw sugar futures fell to session lows by midmorning, suffering losses from last night of between 2.20 and 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 341 lot volume, dealers said.     Lack of follow-through, both here and in New York, featured the extended fall which triggered light liquidation and technical selling as prices eased, dealers said.     There are no tenders expected today but tomorrow sees enquiries by India and Syria, to coincide with the weekly export tender by the European Commission, they said.     Near Aug was trading at 154 dlrs after 70 minutes versus 155.80 bid last night and an early high of 155.80.     London Daily Raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 Fob and 171 (105.50 stg) Cif.     The Whites price was down 2.50 dlrs at 190.  REUTER &#3;
