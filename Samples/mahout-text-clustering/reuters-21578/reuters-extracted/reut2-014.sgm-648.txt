N.Y. OILSEEDS REPORT

Dealers said very little business was done in local oilseeds markets.     Coconut oil was nominally 18 cents a lb for April/May shipment, CIF, New York/Gulf, brokers said.     Crude wet-milled corn oil, FOB, Midwest points, was nominally 20-3/4 cents a lb for nearby shipment. Based on that price, dealers said refined corn oil, FOB, New York, was nominally 27.15 cents a lb.     Peanut oil remained offered at 24-1/2 cents a lb for nearby shipment but dealers said market interest was closer to 24 cents.  Reuter &#3;
