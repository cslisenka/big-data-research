EC SELLS BUTTER STOCKS TO SOVIET UNION

The European Community today sold 181,500 tonnes of ageing butter to the Soviet Union at a special knockdown price, a spokesman for the EC Commission said.     He said the EC's Dairy Management Committee accepted bids from operators to export the butter, mainly from intervention stores in Belgium, West Germany and the Netherlands, at a price of 21.1 European currency units per 100 kilos.     The butter was bought into Community stores at 313.2 Ecus per 100 kilos. The sales are part of the EC's process of attempting to run down its butter surplus.  REUTER &#3;
