LONDON EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS STEADY AT MIDSESSION

Eurodollar deposit rates were little changed at midsession though some firmness was detected at the longer end of the market prompted by a slightly weaker dollar.     Dealers said the market remains extremely thin with no important U.S. Economic indicators due until Friday. Operators are awaiting the outcome of the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Washington tomorrow to review their February accord on currency stability.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony before a Senate subcommittee later today on monetary policy could provide some interest, dealers added.     Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to spot/next quoted at a common 6-1/4 1/8. One week gained 1/16 point to 6-5/16 3/16 pct.     In the period rates, one to five months were unchanged with three months at 6-9/16 7/16 pct. Six months to one year were all 1/16 point firmer with sixes at 6-11/16 9/16 pct and one year at 6-7/8 3/4 pct.  REUTER &#3;
