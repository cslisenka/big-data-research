BRAMPTON BRICK <BBLA.TO> UPS EARNINGS FORECAST

Brampton Brick Ltd said it increased its 1987 earnings forecast to 94 cts a share from the 83 cts a share predicted in its October 30, 1986 public share offering prospectus.     It said increased earnings will result from continuing production at its Toronto Don Valley plant past the original termination date of June 30, 1987, which will double 1987 output. In addition, annual capacity at unit Brique Citadelle was increased by about 15 pct to 48 mln bricks.     The revised earnings forecast is after a May, 1987 agreement to issue 900,000 class A subordinate voting shares.  Reuter &#3;
