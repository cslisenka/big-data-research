Affirmed were USX's BB-plus senior debt, BB-minus subordinated debt and preferred stock, B-plus preference stock and of the units, Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp's BB-plus senior debt .     S and P cited the firm's plan to repurchase up to 20 mln common shares having a value of between 400 and 500 mln dlrs.
