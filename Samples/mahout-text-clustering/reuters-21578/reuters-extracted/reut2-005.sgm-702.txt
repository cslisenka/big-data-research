LATIN NATIONS SET STRATEGY FOR UNCTAD MEETING

Delegates from across Latin America and the Caribbean opened a five-day meeting here today aimed at mapping a regional strategy for this year's meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).     Representatives from 26 nations are participating in the talks here, which well-placed sources said would focus on Latin America's staggering foreign debt and efforts to pull the region out of its worst economic nosedive in more than half a century.     UNCTAD's annual meeting is scheduled for July in Geneva. In april developing countries belonging to the so-called group of 77 will attempt to hammer out a common position for the UNCTAD conference at a preparatory session in Havana, Cuba.  Reuter &#3;
