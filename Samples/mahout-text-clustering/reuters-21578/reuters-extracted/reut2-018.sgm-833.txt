FIRST WISCONSIN <FWB> ADDS LOAN LOSSES

First Wisconsin Corp said directors of its First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee approved a 96 mln dlr increase in the bank's loan loss reserves in response to uncertainty over the impact of third world debt repayment problems.     It said the reserve increase will result in a second quarter loss to the corporation of an estimated 55 mln dlrs, or 2.80 dlrs a share.     However, the company said it expects to report a profit for the year.     It said its consolidated 1987 earnings are projected to be between 35 mln dlrs and 45 mln dlrs compared to 55 mln dlrs in 1986.     It said dividends will not be affected by the increased loan losses.     In April, the company placed 59.7 mln dlrs in loans to Brazil and Ecuador in non-accrual. First Wisconsin also cited "a growing realization that repayment programs for less developed countries will continue to be renegotiated into the foreseeable future." It said its total loan loss reserves now stand at 160 mln dlrs, or 3.5 pct of all outstanding loans.  Reuter &#3;
