YUGOSLAV BANKS MISHANDLED FUNDS, PAPER SAYS

More than half of Yugoslavia's banks have broken the law by mishandling millions of dollars worth of funds, a leading Yugoslav newspaper said.     The daily Borba, official organ of the Yugoslav Socialist Alliance, said 88 of Yugoslavia's 174 commercial banks had used 57 billion dinars for illegal purposes.

He said the offences had boosted inflation, now running close to an annual 100 pct.  REUTER &#3;
