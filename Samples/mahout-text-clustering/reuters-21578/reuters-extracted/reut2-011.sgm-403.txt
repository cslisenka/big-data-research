UNITED TECHNOLOGIES<UTX> UNIT GETS ENGINE ORDER

Pratt and Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said a Swissair order for PW4000 turbofan engines could be worth more than 470 mln dlrs.     Earlier, Swissair said it selected Pratt and Whitney's PW4000 for its new fleet of McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> MD-11 aircraft but gave no value for the engine order.     Pratt and Whitney said the order could include up to 69 engines, including options and spares, and parts, making the order potentially worth 470 mln dlrs.     Swissair's order is for six MD-11 aircraft with an option for another 12 planes.     Pratt and Whitney said Swissair becomes the fifth major carrier to select the PW4000.     The new turbofan engine is scheduled to enter service this summer with Pan American World Airways, a unit of Pan Am Corp <PN> and Singapore Airlines.  Reuter &#3;
