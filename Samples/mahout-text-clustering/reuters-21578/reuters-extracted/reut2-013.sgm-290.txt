IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.     Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels per day, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.  Reuter &#3;
