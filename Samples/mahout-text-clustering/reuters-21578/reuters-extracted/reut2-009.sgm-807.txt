The company said talks are proceeding smoothly with its banks, and it plans to finalize the financing for the recapitalization shortly.  It said assuming Commission approval, it plans to pay the 65 dlr per share dividend associated with the plan in April, with the exact timing depending on the closing of the financing.  Reuter &#3;
