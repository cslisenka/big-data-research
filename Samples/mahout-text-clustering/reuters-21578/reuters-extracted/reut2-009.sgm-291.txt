SPAIN'S SOCIALIST TRADE UNION PUSHES FOR WAGE HIKE

Spain's General Union of Workers (UGT), the trade union arm of the Socialist party, will keep pressing for salary rises of seven pct despite government recommendations for a five pct ceiling, a UGT spokesman said.     Trade union sources said coal mines in Asturias remained closed by protests against planned job cuts. A 24-hour stoppage at the state railways RENFE, coinciding with strikes at two airlines next Friday, was virtually certain to be confirmed. They said construction workers would start a five-day strike next week.     Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last night sought support for his call to limit wage rises in an effort to cut inflation to five pct from 8.3 pct last year. He told a press conference the Socialist government could not meet all demands and would not yield to demagogy.     Antonio Hernandez Mancha, leader of the main opposition right-wing Popular Alliance (AP) party which tabled a motion of no confidence against the government, said Gonzalez had run out of imagination. But political sources said the government, holding an absolute majority in parliament, is sure to survive the no confidence debate opening tomorrow.  REUTER &#3;
