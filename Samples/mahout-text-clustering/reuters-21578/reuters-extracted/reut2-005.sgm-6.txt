BRITISH AIRWAYS <BAB> TO FLY TO TOKYO NON-STOP

British Airways said the British government reached an agreement on new traffic rights with the Japanese government which clears the way for non-stop flights between London and Tokyo.     The flight is scheduled to cut across Siberia, shaving almost six hours off the previous flight path to 11-1/2 hours, British Airways said.     The trans-Siberian route is subject to approval by the USSR, British Airways added.     Under the agreement, British Airways said it will continue to leave Heathrow daily, but the new non-stop service will operate on Thursdays and Saturdays starting early June. The company said return flights will be on Fridays and Sundays.  Reuter &#3;
