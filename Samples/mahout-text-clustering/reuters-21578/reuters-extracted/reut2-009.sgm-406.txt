CATERPILLAR <CAT> WORKERS TOLD TO END SIT-IN

The U.S. Caterpillar Tractor Co was granted a court injunction ordering some 300 workers to end their 10-week occupation of the firm's factory, court sources said.     The workers, staging a sit-in to protest Caterpillar's decision to close the plant with the loss of 1,221 jobs, are due to decide on their next step at a mass meeting tonight.     Yesterday a spokesman for the workers said they would comply with the law if forced out.     Caterpillar wants to dismiss the workforce and close the plant in May.  Reuter &#3;
