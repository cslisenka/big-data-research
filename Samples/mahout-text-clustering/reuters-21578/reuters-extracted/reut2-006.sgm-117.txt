ARGENTINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA

Precipitation diminished over Argentina's summer crop areas in the week ended March 14, the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments Joint Weather Facility said.     In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency said crop areas in Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires received only light scattered showers -- three to 13 millimeters.      The beneficial drier weather allowed drying of fields for summer crop harvesting, following February's heavy rainfall, it said.  Reuter &#3;
