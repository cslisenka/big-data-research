CANADA SEES GLOBAL ACTION TO REDUCE FARM SUBSIDY

Canada's Foreign Minister Joe Clark said there is greater international recognition on the need to reduce government-imposed subsidies on agricultural produce.     "There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies must be reduced, and other reform measures pursued," Clark told a conference of ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) foreign ministers and their counterparts from six industrialised countries.     A delegate said Clark's call for "halting the subsidy war in the agricultural products" to ensure a stable world trading system received warm support from Japan and Australia.     Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has called for "reduction of direct and indirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionist trade practices."     The OECD stand was endorsed by the Venice economic summit this month. However, he said he did not expect any quick solution to the subsidy problem.     Clark said Canadian farmers, like those of ASEAN, "are caught in the cross-fire of an agricultural subsidy war that is not of our making."     Clark said his country will provide 10 mln Canadian dlrs as aid over thu next five years to developing countries of the South Pacific region to finance fisheries and other marine projects.     "The new program, which we estimate will cost about two mln Canadian dlrs a year, will be implemented by t&#127;e International Centre for Ocean Development (ICOD) in close cooperation with the major South Pacific regional organisations," he said.
