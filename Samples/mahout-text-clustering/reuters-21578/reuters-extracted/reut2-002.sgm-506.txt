ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS TAX HIKE TOUGH WITHOUT REAGAN

House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, said his committee would raise taxes if the idea were approved by Democrats as part of the 1988 budget, but the committee would find it difficult since President Reagan opposes tax increases.     "There's always the question of how to do it without Ronald Reagan. I'd rather have him than not," he told reporters after a meeting with House Speaker James Wright.     Wright approached the taxwriters with a tentative plan to raise 18 billion dlr in taxes in 1988 as part of a 36 billion dlr budget deficit reduction plan.  Reuter &#3;
