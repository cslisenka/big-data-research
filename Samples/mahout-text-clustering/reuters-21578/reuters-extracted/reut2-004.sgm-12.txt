RAN SCANDAL PARTICIPANT TO GET IMMUNITY OFFER

Albert Hakim, an arms merchant, is the first top-ranked player in the Iran arms scandal who may be enticed into testifying by the promise of immunity, investigators said.     The House Select committee probing the Iran arms scandal has voted to grant limited immunity from criminal prosecution to Hakim in return for his testimony.     Hakim, 51, was said deeply involved from the start in the attempt to trade arms to Iran for help in freeing American hostages in Lebanon and the diversion of funds and arms to rebels in Nicaragua.
