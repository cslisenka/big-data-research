TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES CLOSING BANK LOOPHOLE

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the administration still opposes Senate Banking Committee legislation that would close a key loophole in federal bankinng law.     The loophole has spawned a proliferation of limited service banks known as non-bank banks that can engage in risky activities barred to traditional banks.     Baker has been asked to support the legislation by Banking Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc).     Proxmire's panel approved closing the loophole in a bill recapitalizing the thrift insurance fund.     Baker said the administration supports moving a bill through Congress that would address only the recapitalization issue, for fear such "collateral provisions" as the loophole-closing measure would stall the bill.     Proxmire later told reporters he backs the committee bill with or without administration support.     "I'm going to push it through in any event," he said.     The administration also opposes the committee bill on grounds it bars new banking powers.     The administration is a long time backer of banking deregulation.  Reuter &#3;
