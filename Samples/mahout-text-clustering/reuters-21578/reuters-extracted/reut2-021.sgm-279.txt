BUNDESBANK WILL NOT HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE THURSDAY

The Bundesbank will not hold a news conference after its regular fortnightly central bank council meeting on Thursday, a spokesman said in answer to enquiries.     The council is meeting in West Berlin, where it meets once a year. It also meets once a year in another German city. These meetings outside Frankfurt are traditionally followed by a news conference. The spokesman declined to comment further.     In Bonn a finance ministry spokesman said Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg would take part in the meeting in West Berlin. His participation was arranged long ago, he added.  REUTER &#3;
