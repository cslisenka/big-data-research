ANALYST REITERATES BUY ON SOME DRUG STOCKS

Merrill Lynch and Co analyst Richard Vietor said he reiterated a buy recommendation on several drug stocks today.     The stocks were Bristol-Myers Co <BMY>, which rose 2-1/4 to 101, Schering-Plough Corp <SGP> 2-7/8 to 97 and Syntex Corp <SYN> 1-3/8 to 82. Vietor described these stocks as a "middle group" of performers.     Vietor said the prices of these stocks, "look pretty cheap relative to the leading performers in the drug group, such as Upjohn Co <UPJ>, Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, and Squibb Corp <SQB>."     Vietor said he also mentioned Pfizer Inc <PFE> up two to 72-3/4 and Warner-Lambert Co <WLA> up 1-1/2 to 74-1/2 as being in the middle group. But he did not recommend those stocks, which he rates as neutral.                                          Reuter &#3;
