CHICAGO PACIFIC <CPA> TO REPURCHASE NOTES

Chicago Pacific Corp chairman Harvey Kapnick told analysts that he expects within the next year to repurchase about 25 mln dlrs of the company's 200 mln dlr issue of 14 pct subordinated notes.     To date the company has repurchased about 60 mln of these notes.     "This will have a beneficial effect on our net income but the effects in 1987 have already been anticipated in estimates for 1987," Kapnick said.     Earlier, Kapnick said that analysts' 1987 projections of 31 to 35 mln dlrs or 3.10 dlrs to 3.40 dlrs for earnings for operations are reasonable. These compare to 2.30 dlrs or 22 mln dlrs for 1986.     Since November 1985, Chicago Pacific has acquired the <Hoover Co> and <Rowenta>, both appliance companies and furniture companies <Kippinger/Pennsylvania House Group Inc>  and the <McGuire Co>.     The company spent a total of 724.8 mln dlrs on acquisitions.         "We believe our balance sheets provides us with about 300 mln dlrs for future acquisitions,"  Kapnick said.     Kapnick also said he expects sales of the company's appliance division to increase 17 pct from the 915.7 mln dlrs reported in 1986.     Kapnick further said the 67 mln dlrs of trademarks and patents will be reduced to 40 mln dlrs due to net loss carryforwards of acquired companies which were offset against these assets as required by current accounting principles.
