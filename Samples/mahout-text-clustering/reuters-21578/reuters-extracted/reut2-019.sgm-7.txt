FORMER SHEARSON <SHE> OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY

Mark Stahl, 45, who was a former senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, until his suspension on April 16, today admitted in U.S. District court here, embezzling almost 19 mln dlrs from his firm over the past year.     He entered a guilty plea before United States District Court Judge Vincent Broderick to four specific charges totaling 1,031,000 dlrs on wire fraud.     Stahl, who was a senior vice president for finance, told the judge that the total embezzlement amounted to "a little less than" 19 mln dlrs.         Through an attorney, Stahl agreed to make restitution to Shearson Lehman of all the embezzled funds if possible. However his guilty pleas today to the four counts will cover all criminal liability of the embezzlement that occurred between April 1986 to last April.     Judge Broderick scheduled sentencing for December nine.     Stahl faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail and one mln dlrs in fines, or both.  Reuter &#3;
