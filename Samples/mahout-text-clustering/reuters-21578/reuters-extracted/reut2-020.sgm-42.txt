BANK OF JAPAN SEES STEADY ECONOMIC RECOVERY

The Japanese economy is firmly on the recovery path, supported by robust domestic demand, the Bank of Japan said in a regular monthly report.     The report said industrial production is strengthening as manufacturing companies have almost completed adjustments of their plant and equipment investment while non-manufacturing firms have continued to be positive in their capital spending.     Strong domestic demand, such as consumer spending and housing investment, will more than offset declining exports, the central bank report said. It also noted the continued rise in domestic wholesale prices and money supply.  REUTER &#3;
