FRANCE'S BUE SIGNS SOVIET COOPERATION ACCORD

<Banque de l'Union Europeenne> said it signed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union's central bank <Gosbank>, and Foreign Trade Bank <Vneshtorgbank>, with the aim of creating a joint financial holding under new Soviet joint venture laws.     Jean-Paul Dessertine, international director at BUE, said the function of the proposed joint financial group, would be to help set up, with consulting and financial services, other Franco-Soviet, mainly industrial, joint ventures.     Some protocols of intent have already been signed but no joint venture contracts have been finalised under the new laws.     Dessertine said a joint working party would on April 15 begin consulting with companies interested in making joint ventures, and work to set up the joint financial holding.     Citing the mixed results of joint ventures set up in the past between western and East European countries, he said:     "This is a wager on the evolution of the Soviet Union, and on how far new reforms will be applied."     Other parties to the cooperation protocol are <Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord>, a French subsidiary of Gosbank, and <Compagnie Financiere de Credit Industriel et Commercial>, the parent company of BUE.
