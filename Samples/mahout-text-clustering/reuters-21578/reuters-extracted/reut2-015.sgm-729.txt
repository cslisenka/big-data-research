ISRAEL IN NINTH AIR RAID OVER LEBANON THIS YEAR

Israeli helicopter gunships attacked Palestinian guerrilla positions near Sidon in southern Lebanon today in the ninth air raid over Lebanon this year, the military spokesman said.     "All our aircraft returned safely to base and the pilots reported accurate hits," he said. The aircraft returned ground fire, he said.     The targets, three buildings on the outskirts of Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp, were command posts for planning guerrilla attacks, the military said.     The army says Israel's air raids on its northern neighbour, averaging two a month, are aimed mostly at Palestinian guerrilla bases, weapons depots and launching posts for attacks against Israel.     The last Israeli Air Force attack was on March 23.  Reuter &#3;
