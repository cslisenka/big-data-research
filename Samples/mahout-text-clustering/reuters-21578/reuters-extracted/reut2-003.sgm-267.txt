GULF OF MEXICO RIG COUNT UNCHANGED THIS WEEK

Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in the Gulf of Mexico was unchanged at 35.6 pct during the past week, a level that has remained relatively steady since January due largely to a reduction of nine rigs in the Gulf fleet, Offshore Data Services said.     The total number of working rigs was 83 for the week, compared to 83 last week and 129 rigs one year ago.     Offshore Data Services said the worldwide utilization rate fell 0.3 pct to 53.9 pct with a total of 335 idled rigs. The number of rigs contracted worldwide was 392.     In the European-Mediterranean area, rig utilization also remained unchanged at 41.3 pct during the past week with 64 of 155 rigs contracted.  Reuter &#3;
