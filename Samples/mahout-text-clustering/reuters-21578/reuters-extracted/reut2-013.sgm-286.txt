MINAS DE ALMADEN TO HOLD MADRID MERCURY CONFERENCE

Spain's Minas de Almaden y Arrayanes S.A. Said it will host a conference of mercury producers here at the end of April to study how to stimulate low mercury prices.     Last week, Almaden and Algerian producer ENOF agreed to establish a minimum price of 300 dlrs per flask (34.5 kilos) for spot mercury sales, up from the previous minimum of 240 dlrs.     A Minas de Almaden statement said the non-communist world's main mercury producers had decided not to sign any contracts using the reference price of specialist publications, because it was well below their costs of production.
