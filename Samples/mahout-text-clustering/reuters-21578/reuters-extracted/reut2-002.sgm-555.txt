NATIONAL OPPOSITION AHEAD IN N.Z. OPINION POLL

The opposition National Party took a five percentage point lead over New Zealand's Labour government in an opinion poll, reversing the seven point lead held by Labour in a comparable poll in February.     In the regular Television New Zealand Heylen/Eyewitness poll, National's support rose to 50 pct against 45 pct a month earlier while Labour's popularity dropped to 45 pct from 52 pct. National has not been ahead in this poll since April.     This result contrasts with a newspaper poll published yesterday that put Labour's popularity at 50 pct and National's at 44 pct.     Both polls showed large numbers of voters are uncommitted.     Approval of the government's handling of the economy also dropped in the television poll, to 34 pct from 40 pct.     Prime Minister David Lange remained first choice as Prime Minister but with 25 pct against 28 pct last month. Opposition leader Jim Bolger remained steady on nine pct in this category but his colleague and former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon rose two points to 18 pct.     An election is due to be held before September this year.  REUTER  &#3;
