CSR LTD SAYS IT WILL SELL HEAD OFFICE BUILDINGS

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> said it will sell its head office group of five buildings in central Sydney as part of plans to decentralise.     The 2,750 square metre site will be repurchased under existing lease-back agreements and then sold by public tender, it said in a statement.     CSR's sugar and oil divisions have already moved to Brisbane and the company said it plans further moves from central Sydney to reduce its head office staff to about 100 from 550.  REUTER &#3;
