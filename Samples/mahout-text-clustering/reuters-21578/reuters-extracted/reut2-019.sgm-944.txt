S/P REVIEWS REICHHOLD CHEMICALS <RCI> RATING

Standard and Poor's Corp said it has placed Reichhold Chemicals Inc's BBB-minus rated subordinated debt on Creditwatch with developing implications following Dainippon Inc and Chemicals Inc's unsolicited bid for Reichhold. About 60 mln dlrs of debt is affected.     S and P said that, if Dainippon is successful, it is likely to discontinue its surveillance of Reichhold's debt, since sufficient credit information probably will not be available. A similar approach exists with respect to Polychrome Corp, which was acquired by Dainippon several years ago.  Reuter &#3;
