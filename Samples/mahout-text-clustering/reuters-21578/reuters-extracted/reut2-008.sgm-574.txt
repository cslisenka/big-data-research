CANADA'S MULRONEY TO MEET WITH ANC LEADER

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has agreed to meet African National Congress president Oliver Tambo in Ottawa sometime in late April or early May, a senior official for the outlawed South African organization said.     Mac Maharaz said Mulroney and Tambo would discuss more possible Canadian sanctions against the South African government.     Maharaz, visiting Ottawa to speak to a conference on native Indian rights, said Tambo would urge Mulroney to cut all diplomatic and economic ties with South Africa.     He said that Tambo would also ask Mulroney to refuse diplomatic accreditation to South Africa's newly designated ambassador to Canada, Johannes de Klerk.     "I certainly would regard Canada's refusal to accept the accreditation of any further ambassador as a significant movement," said Maharaz. "I think in diplomatic protocol, it would be a major signal."  Reuter &#3;
