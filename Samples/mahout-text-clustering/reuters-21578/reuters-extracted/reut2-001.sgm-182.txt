ITALIAN GOVERNMENT RESIGNS

Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and his five-party coalition government have resigned, officials said.     A statement from the Quirinal presidential palace said head of state Francesco Cossiga had reserved his decision on whether to accept the resignation, normal procedure when a government stands down.     The statement said Cossiga had asked Craxi, who has been prime minister for a post-war record of three-and-a-half years, to continue to handle current government business.  REUTER &#3;
