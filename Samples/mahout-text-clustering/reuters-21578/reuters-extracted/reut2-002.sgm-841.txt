OFFICIAL SAYS REAGAN AGAINST EARLY SDI DEPLOYMENT

A senior Defense Department official said he believed President Reagan has decided against an early deployment of the controversial anti-missile defense system known as "Star Wars."     But the official, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle, told a luncheon Reagan could decide within a few weeks to adopt a less restrictive interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to justify a move towards wider "Star Wars" testing and development.     "I think the president has made a decision not to proceed with an early deployment of SDI," said Perle, referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Reagan's anti-missile project is formally called.
