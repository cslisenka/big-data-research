LOUISVILLE GAS<LOU> TO ASK PROTECTIVE MEASURES

Louisville Gas and Electric Co said it will ask stockholders at its May 12 annual meeting to approve several anti-takeover proposals.     It said the measures include staggered terms for directors and a fair price provision that would require a potential purchaser to make the same offer to all stockholders.     Louisville Gas said the amendments are not in response to any specific effort to obtain control of the company.  Reuter &#3;
