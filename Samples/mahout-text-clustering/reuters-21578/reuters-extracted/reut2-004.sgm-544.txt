JUDGE DISMISSES NORTH'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING IRAN

A U.S. judge today dismissed a lawsuit by fired White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver North seeking to halt a special prosecutor's investigation into the Iran arms scandal.     In a 21-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Barrington Parker threw out North's suit challenging the constitutionality of the law empowering special prosecutor  Walsh to investigate secret arms sales to Iran and the diversion of profits to "contra" rebels in Nicaragua.     "The nation demands an expeditious and complete disclosure of our government's involvement in the Iran-contra affair," Parker ruled.  Reuter &#3;
