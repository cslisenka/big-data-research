STRONG POINT INC HAS IMMUNE SYSTEM FORMULA

<Strong Point Inc> said its Pharmaceutical Technologies Inc unit has developed a formula for stimulating immune system function and reparing immune system damage, thereby protecting vulnerable body structures against Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).     The company said while the product, called IMMUNOL-IM, is not a cure, treatment or prevention, it repairs, rebuilds and stimulates the immune system, enabling the body to protect itself and repair damage.     Strong Point said it plans to begin studies in Europe within 45 days and to make IMMUNOL-IM available in the U.S. as soon as possible, pending appropriate government clearances.  Reuter &#3;
