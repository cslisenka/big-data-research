U.S. AIDES SEE MOSCOW AGREEING TO ARMS CHECK PACT

Senior U.S. Arms control officials said they were optimistic the United States and Soviet Union could reach agreement on ways to verify a pact to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.     Chief U.S. Arms control negotiator Max Kampelman said on the NBC television network a fair pact would be hard to negotiate, but, "We are determined to do it."     Assistant Secretary of Defence for international security policy Richard Perle said he thought the two sides could agree on a method to ensure each side was honouring a missile pact.     President Reagan said on Friday that Secretary of State George Shultz would go to Moscow next month for talks on arms control and a possible U.S.-Soviet summit meeting.     The decision to send Shultz to Moscow followed an announcement by Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev that he was willing to separate elimination of medium-range missiles in Europe from his demand for curbs on U.S. Development of a Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) anti-missile system.     Kampelman said the United States and the Soviet Union both had a general definition of so-called "intrusive" or on-site inspection of a pact, but details would be tough to work out.  Reuter &#3;
