CONTINENTAL, EASTERN <EAL> COMBINE PROGRAMS

Texas Air Corp's Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines said they will combine their frequent flyer programs in late April.     Frequent flyer members will begin receiving one monthly statement that reflects combined earnings from both Continental and Eastern, the companies said.     Continental said reciprocity between the two programs was established in June 1986 and allowed members of either program to earn miles and redeem points for rewards from the other carrier.
