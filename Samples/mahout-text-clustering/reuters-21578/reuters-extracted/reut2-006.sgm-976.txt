SOUTH KOREA'S LUCKY-GOLDSTAR TO MAKE CANON CAMERAS

<Goldstar Precision Co Ltd>, part of South Korea's <Lucky-Goldstar Group>, agreed with Japan's Canon Inc <CANN.T> to make cameras using Canon technology, a Goldstar spokesman told reporters.     He told reporters Goldstar will invest 25 billion won over the next five years and would pay Canon three pct of total sales, which are targetted at eight billion won this year, 25 to 30 billion next year and 76 billion in 1991, as royalties.     Most of Goldstar's output, due to start in July, will be sold in South Korea, he said.     However, the Goldstar spokesman said, Canon has agreed in principle to buy an unspecified number of cameras for resale in Japan under its own name, he said, without providing further details.     In Tokyo, a Canon spokesman said that under the agreement Canon would sell facilities, components and technology worth 1.5 billion yen to Goldstar in calendar 1987 and 3.5 billion in 1988, he said.     He said Goldstar plans to make 35-mm single-lens reflex cameras and 35-mm compact cameras at an annual rate of 70,000 in 1987 and 200,000 in 1988.     The camera market in South Korea is expected to expand rapidly ahead of the 1988 Olympic Games scheduled to be held there, the Canon spokesman said.     South Korean camera demand rose to 700,000 in 1986 from 640,000 in 1985. Cameras made with foreign assistance accounted for 65 pct of cameras sold in South Korea, he said.     Minolta Camera Co Ltd <MNLT.T>, <Asahi Optical Co Ltd> and Nippon Kogaku KK <GAKU.T> already assemble 35-mm cameras with South Korean partners.  REUTER &#3;
