PENTAGON SAYS NO DECISION YET ON EGYPT TANK DEAL

The Reagan Administration is discussing a deal with Cairo under which Egypt would build the U.S. M-1A1 battle tank, a high-speed weapon packed with laser and other technology, Pentagon officials said.     But they denied a Washington Post report that the Administration has already approved a production license, which would entail transfer of sensitive technology to Egypt.     "We have been talking with Egyptian officials about also producing the tank, but there is a long way to go before any decision is made," one Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
