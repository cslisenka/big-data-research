"It's intended that we will be a global media company in the fullness of time," Bond said.     Bond Media will bring together Bond's existing broadcasting interests and those recently acquired from Packer's <Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd>.     Bond Corp shareholders are being offered 50 pct of the new company at 1.55 dlrs a share on a three-for-four basis.     A presentation by underwriters A C Goode and Co Ltd and Rivkin James Capel Ltd forecast Bond Media's net profit at 41 mln dlrs in 1987/88 ending June 30, rising to 72 mln in 1989/90.  REUTER &#3;
