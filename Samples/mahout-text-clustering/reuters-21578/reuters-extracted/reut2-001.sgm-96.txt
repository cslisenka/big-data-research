LYPHOMED <LMED> IN JOINT MARKETING PACT

LyphoMed Inc said it has tentatively agreed to form a joint venture with privately-held Novopharm Ltd of Canada whereby each will market the other's drug in their home country.     LyphoMed will sell Novopharm's oral pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S. and Novopharm will sell Lyphomed's injectable pharmaceutical drugs in Canada, it said.     The joint venture gives LyphoMed entry into the hospital and retail oral pharmaceutical market with Novopharm's product line. Novopharm in turn will strengthen its position in the Canadian hospital market using LyphoMed's injectable products.     The first product to be marketed will be cephalexin monohydrate, now marketed by Eli Lilly Co <LLY> as Keflex, a product whose patent expires in April. Keflex is an antibiotic with a current market in excess of 250 mln dlrs. It will be made by Novopharm in Canada, sold to the new joint venture, and distributed by LyphoMed in the U.S., it said.
