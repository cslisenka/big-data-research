SPAIN'S PRIVATE BANK STAFF STRIKE, IMPACT UNCLEAR

Spain's private bank staff started a one and a half day strike over wage demands but its impact was not yet clear.     Spokesmen for several of the main banks said strikers at their Madrid headquarters appeared to be a small minority. They had yet to receive reports from branches.     Unions called out the 160,000 employees to press for cuts in working hours and an eight pct wage rise. Banks implemented a 4.75 pct wage increase last month.  REUTER &#3;
