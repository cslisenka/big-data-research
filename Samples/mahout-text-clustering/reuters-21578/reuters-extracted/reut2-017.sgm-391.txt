KENYA'S TEA AND COFFEE AREAS CONTINUE DRY

Kenya's coffee and tea growing areas remained generally dry for the second consecutive week, in the period to April 28, weather and farming sources said.     All areas east and west of the Rift Valley recorded below 25 mm of rain with western Kericho town having only 21 mm, they said. Kericho, which last year received 387 mm in April last year, has so far recorded only 176 mm and little rain is forecast throughout the country in the next two days.     Tea and coffee crops are doing well but farmers fear that output will be low if the unusually dry spell continues. April is normally the wettest month in Kenya.  Reuter &#3;
