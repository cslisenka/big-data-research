GERMAN METALWORKERS' WAGE TALKS BEGIN WEDNESDAY

Negotiations scheduled between the metalworkers' IG Metall union and employers to resolve an impasse over a new contract will start on Wednesday, the union said in a statement.     IG Metall is demanding a 35-hour week, with a parallel increase in wages of five pct. Employers Gesamtmetall have offered a half-hour shortening in the current working week, to 38 hours, and an initial rise of 2.8 pct.     IG Metall, under newly-elected leader Franz Steinkuehler, proposed the talks on Thursday, after regional negotiations in the northern part of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg collapsed.  REUTER &#3;
