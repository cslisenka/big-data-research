FINANCIAL TIMES LAUNCHES NEW WORLD SHARE INDEX

The Financial Times newspaper said it has launched a new international share index, which represents more than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. The FT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today, feature a main world share index and indices plotting the movement of share prices in different regions and individual countries, the FT said.     The first world share indices will be published on an up-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of around 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.     Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices for UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and published in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a series of regional indices together with the overall world index.     The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of measurements against which the performance of international fund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and securities have been included only when direct holdings of shares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said to keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of companies from the U.S. To 600.     The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies - the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.     The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes into account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The gross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what foreign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding taxes.     The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after the enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity investment in recent years. REUTER...^M &#3;
