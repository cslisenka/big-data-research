NO SWISS NATIONAL BANK INTERVENTION SEEN

A Swiss National Bank spokesman said the bank had not intervened in currency markets today and dealers said they had seen no evidence of Bundesbank action outside West Germany.     Frankfurt dealers reported that the Bundesbank bought dollars for yen in the open market there.     Zurich dealers said the absence of the Swiss National Bank suggested that no concerted intervention was under way.     Asked earlier today if the Swiss National Bank had intervened, the spokesman said "not yet."  REUTER &#3;
