CFTC URGED TO STRENGTHEN FOREIGN FUTURES RULES

Several U.S. House members urged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to strengthen its proposed rules governing the sale of foreign futures and options in the U.S.       "I'm from the state of Illinois, and we don't want to see Chicago's futures markets become the automobile or textile industry of the 1980s," Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.       U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposed regulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge over domestic futures sellers because they would be subject to less rigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.       Phillips said the commission has no way of requiring foreign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards as in the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketing of foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.      "If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets, they know they will not have the same regulations," she said.       Phillips said the commission would consider changes in its proposal to require segregation of customer accounts and clarify the treatment of contracts not traded on foreign exchanges.  Reuter &#3;
