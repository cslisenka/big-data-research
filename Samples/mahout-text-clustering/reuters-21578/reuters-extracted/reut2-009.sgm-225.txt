CHINA MUST REFORM IRRATIONAL PRICE SYSTEM, ZHAO

China's Premier Zhao Ziyang said the country must continue to reform its "irrational" price system although this will mean price rises and cause living standards for some people to fall.     Zhao said China's price system is irrational due to "prolonged negligence of the law of value and due to the rigid and excessive state control."     "The prices of farm products, energy, raw and semi-finished materials and other primary products have long been too low and many products have long been in short supply," he said.     Price reforms are necessary to "establish a new vigorous socialist economic structure, to effectively promote production and commodity circulation and provide correct guidance to consumption," Zhao added.     Reforms are bound to lead to a rise in the general price level but will only be implemented after careful studies so as to keep the increase within the capacity of society and the people "to withstand the strain."      He said the general price level will rise in 1987 less than in 1986, with price increases of a very small number of products.  REUTER &#3;
