JM BYGGNADS SHARES SUSPENDED ON STOCKHOLM BOURSE

Shares in building firm <JM Byggnads och Fastighets AB> were suspended on the Stockholm bourse at the company's own request, the bourse said.     The suspension will last until the end of trading on Friday, the bourse added in a statement, but gave no further details.     JM is half-owned by Skanska AB <SKBS ST>, which has offered to buy out the remaining stock, but analysts said JM could have been approached with a rival bid.  Reuter &#3;
