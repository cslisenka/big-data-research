SHARON STEEL <SSH> FILES CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY

Sharon Steel Corp said it has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.     The company, which has been losing money and experiencing financial difficulties for years, said it took the action in response to Quantum Fund's notice that it intended to accelerate the maturity of Sharon's 13-1/2 pct subordinated debentures due 2000 at 1200 EDT today.     Sharon said Quantum had requested the trustee for the debentures to file an involuntary petition under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code against it.     Sharon Steel said as a result of the bankruptcy filing, its exchange offer has been terminated.     Sharon had been making an exchange offer for its 13.5 pct debentures due 2000 and 14.25 pct debentures due 1999 that was subject to a number of conditions being met.  Acceptance of the offer, which had been extended several times, had been below required levels for its completion.  Reuter &#3;
