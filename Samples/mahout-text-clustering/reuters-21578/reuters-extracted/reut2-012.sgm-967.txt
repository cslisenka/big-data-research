U.S. SENATE VOTES TO CUT PANAMA AID

The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate voted to slash foreign aid to Panama because of drug trafficking, but sided with President Reagan by refusing to cut U.S. aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperate fully with the American war against drugs.     In what Senate opponents of a cutoff said was a surprise, the Senate voted 58 to 31 to halve aid to Panama.     The measure, which the administration opposes, would need House approval before any aid would be stopped.     Panama is due to receive 28.5 mln dlrs in U.S. aid this year. A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations committee said if the House approves the measure too, half of this aid would be stopped.  Reuter &#3;
