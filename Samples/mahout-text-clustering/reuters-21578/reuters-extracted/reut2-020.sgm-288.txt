NYSE ASKS FOR NO PROGRAMS ON DELIVERY SYSTEM

The New York Stock Exchange said it has asked members and member firms to refrain from using the NYSE order delivery system for purposes of executing index arbitrage related transactions or any other aspect of program trading after today's opening.     The request came in a letter issued by the NYSE earlier this morning.     The Exchange said the order delivery system allows member firms to directly route orders to the specialist on the trading floor via computer.  Reuter &#3;
