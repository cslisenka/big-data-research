BET SAYS RESULTS SHOW STRATEGY IS WORKING

BET Plc <BETL.L> said slightly higher than expected results for the year to March showed that its strategy was working. BET raised pretax profits in the year to 157.4 mln stg from 124.6 mln previously.     It had continued to build on a range of complementary services through a combination of organic growth and carefully targetted acquisitions.     A company statement said it was confident that the figures would provide an effective springboard for the broadening of its shareholder base, particularly through the issue of American Depositary Receipts in the U.S. Later this year.     BET also said it was appointing Sir Timothy Bevan, formerly chairman of Barclays Plc to replace Sir Hugh Dundas when he retires as Chairman in December.     BET's net debt fell four pct in the year to 262 mln stg with gearing down to 63 pct from 65 pct.     Returns on assets, sales  and capital employed showed further improvement in the period.     BET shares at 0907 GMT were quoted at 291p, one penny firmer on last night's close.  REUTER &#3;
