SANDOZ PLANS WEEDKILLER JOINT VENTURE IN USSR

Sandoz AG said it planned a joint venture to produce herbicides in the Soviet Union.     The company said it had signed a letter of intent with the Soviet Ministry of Fertiliser Production to form the first foreign joint venture the ministry had undertaken since the Soviet Union allowed Western firms to enter into joint ventures two months ago.     The ministry and Sandoz will each have a 50 pct stake, but a company spokeswoman was unable to give details of the size of investment or planned output.  Reuter &#3;
