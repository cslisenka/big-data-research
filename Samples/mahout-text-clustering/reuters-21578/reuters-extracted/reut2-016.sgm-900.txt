ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT TO SEEK STATE OF SIEGE

The Argentine government will ask congress to declare a state of siege following a rebellion by army officers objecting to human rights trials, official sources said.     Earlier, Army Chief of Staff Hector Rios Erenu said he would use all the means at his disposal to put down the rebellion. He relieved from their commands two colonels, one of them at an airborne infantry regiment in Cordoba, centre of the uprising.     Argentine Army Chief of Staff Hector Rios Erenu said he would begin moving troops for a possible military operation to put down the almost three-day old rebellion.     Interior Minister Antonio Troccoli said the government would seek parliamentary approval of the state of siege "unless there is something unexpected that justifies more urgent treatment."
