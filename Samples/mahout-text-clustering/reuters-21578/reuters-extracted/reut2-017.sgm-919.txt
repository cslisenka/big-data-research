JAPAN TO BUY THREE BILLION YEN U.S. SUPERCOMPUTER

Japan planned to buy a three billion yen supercomputer as part of a policy of importing more U.S. Goods, a spokesman for the private business group Kansai Economic Federation told Reuters by telephone from Osaka.     The supercomputer would be bought from Cray Research Inc <CYR.N> of the U.S., The spokesman said.     He said the supercomputer would not necessarily be bought this year but eventually it would be installed at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International. The Institute conducts telecommunications research and was formed in 1986 with government and private funds.     The United States has been pressing Japan to open its public sector market to sales of U.S. Supercomputers.     Ministry of International Trade and Industry officials concerned with the supercomputer issue were unavailable for comment.  REUTER &#3;
