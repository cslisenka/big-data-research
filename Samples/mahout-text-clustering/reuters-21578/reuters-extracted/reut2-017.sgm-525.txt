Bausch and Lomb said it plans to launch a new line of soft contact lens care products in the United States.     The company said the line will be marketed under the ReNu tradename, and will involve fomulations which will enhance the convenience of contact lens cleaning and disinfecting.     Bausch and Lomb said the two products, which are scheduled for shipment in late July, are ReNu Multi-Action Disinfecting Solution and ReNu Sterile Preserved Saline.         According to the company, the ReNu disinfecting solution is a single-step product for cold disinfection and the ReNu saline solution contains a new preservative with very low potential for eye irritation.     The company said another product in this line, ReNu Enzymatic Tablets, was introduced in December.     Additionally, the company said patents are currently pending on all three ReNu products, and that other solutions will be added to the ReNu line following Food and Drug Administration approval.
