FORD <F> UNIT OFFERS CURRENCY EXCHANGE WARRANTS

Bear Stearns Cos Inc <BSC> said an offering of three mln currency exchange warrants of Ford Motor Co's Ford Motor Credit unit is underway at 4.375 dlrs each.     Each warrant allows the holder to receive from Ford Credit the cash value in U.S. dollars of the right to purchase 50 dlrs at a price of 7,610 yen. Bear Stearns said the spot exchange rates of the yen and dollar will determine whether the warrants have a cash value on a given day.     It said the warrants will have a cash settlement value only if the dollar is worth over 152.20 yen.     The company said if a warrant has not been exercised, and at its expiration the value of the dollar is not more than 152.20 yen, the warrant will expire with no cash settlement value.     It said the warrants will be exercisable immediately and expire in five years, and any warrant not exercised before then will be automatically exercised on July 1, 1992.     Bear Stearns said this is the second time a currency warrant issue has been sold in the U.S., the first being a two mln warrant issue for General Electric Co's <GE> General Electric Credit Corp unit on June 10.
