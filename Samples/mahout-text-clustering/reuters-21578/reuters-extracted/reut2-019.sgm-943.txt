SENATOR GORE ENTERS PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Tennessee Senator Albert Gore, seeking to become the youngest president in U.S. history, entered the 1988 presidential race today with a pledge to return respect for the law and common sense to the White House.     Gore, a four-term member of the House of Representatives and a Senator since 1985, became the sixth official entrant in the race for the Democratic nomination.     Public opinion polls show him running near the bottom against the other declared candidates.  Reuter &#3;
