AMERICAN EXCHANGE INTRODUCES INSTITUTIONAL INDEX

The American Stock Exchange said it has introduced options with expirations of up to three years on the Institutional Index.     With the ticker symbol <XII>, the index is a guage of the core equity holdings of the nation's largest institutions, the exchange explained.     The new listings represent the first long-term options to be traded by the Amex, it added.     It said the long-term Institutional Index options began trading Monday with expirations of December 1988 <XIV> and December 1989 <XIX>.         The Amex said a third long-term option with an expiration of December 1990 will begin trading following the December 1987 expiration.     It said strike prices on the long-term options have been set at 50 point intervals with initial strikes of 250, 300 and 350. To avoid conflicting strike price codes, the 350 stike prices will carry the ticker symbols <XVV> for the option expiring in December 1988 and <XVX> for the option expiring in December 1989.
