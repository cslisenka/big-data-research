SEN DOLE SAYS GREENSPAN WILL BE GOOD FED CHAIRMAN

Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said Alan Greenspan would be a good replacement for Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve Chairman.     "While Paul Volcker's retirement is a real loss, this country is very fortunate to have a man of Alan Greenspan's caliber to take his place," Dole said in a statement.     "Alan's knowledge of the economy, coupled with his experience at the top levels of government, means that the leadership of the Federal Reserve Board will be in good hands. Alan, literally, has some big shoes to fill. But I haven't any doubts he's more than equal to the task," Dole said.  Reuter &#3;
