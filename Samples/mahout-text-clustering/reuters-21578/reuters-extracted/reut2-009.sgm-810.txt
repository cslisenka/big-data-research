ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS REAGAN MUST RECONSIDER TAX RISE

Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee said today President Reagan must reconsider his consistent opposition to any tax increases.     The Illinois Democrat, asked on a television interview (on NBC-Today) about the possibility of tax hikes, said, "I think the president is going to have to reconsider."     He added, "I just hope there's enough vision in this administration to recognize that our deficits are intolerable and the only way we're going to do it is by raising revenues."  Reuter &#3;
