LIVE HOG FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO HIGHER

Live Hog futures were expected to open steady to mostly higher after yesterday's mostly higher close.     Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by firmer live calls and the continued discount of futures to cash. Hog runs are light as farmers are starting spring fieldwork in some areas, they noted.     Private reports of steady to firm cash pork products and a rise in the cutout yesterday was adding to packer interest for cash hogs, they said.     Spillover strength from higher cattle pits is also likely again today, they added.  Reuter &#3;
