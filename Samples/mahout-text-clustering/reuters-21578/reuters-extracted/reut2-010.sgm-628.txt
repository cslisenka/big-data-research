CHINA, ISRAEL DISCUSS MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROSPECTS

China and Israel, which have no diplomatic relations, discussed Middle East peace prospects and related matters at a meeting in New York city, an Israeli spokesman said.     Taking part in the talks at an undisclosed location were China's U.N. Representative, Ambassador Li Luye, and the director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Abraham Tamir.     "It was in a U.N. Context rather than a bilateral context, and one of a series of meetings being held with members of the Security Council," Israeli U.N. Spokesman Eyal Arad said.     The meeting, which dealt with "the peace process and related matters," was held at Israel's initiative and was arranged by the two countries' U.N. Missions, he added.     While in New York, Tamir has conferred with a number of U.N. Diplomats, including the representative of the Soviet Union, with which Israel also has no diplomatic relations.     Increasing attention has been focused in recent months on prospects for a U.N.-sponsored Middle East peace conference that would include the five permanent members of the Security Council -- China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France.
