BRISTOL-MYERS <BMY> FILES AIDS VACCINE WITH FDA

Bristol-Myers Co said it has filed an investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requesting the agency to allow it to begin testing its AIDS vaccine in humans.     The company said it filed the application on behalf of its Oncogen subsidiary, which developed the vaccine. It did not name the drug.     Bristol-Myers, the third largest drug company in the U.S., said that "considerable work remains to be done before it is determined whether a new drug application will be develpoed for submission to FDA."     An investigational new drug application is the first step in testing an agent. After clinical studies establish the safety and efficacy of an agent, a company then submits a new drug application to the FDA. It may take three to five years before a new drug application is submitted and another two to three years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.     Earlier this month, Bristol-Myers said the vaccine produced antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine uses a live smallpox vaccine to carry two protein on the AIDS virus that may, in theory, prod the immune system to produce neutralizaing antibodies against AIDS.     The company is the second U.S. organization that has sought premission for human testing of an AIDS vaccine. At team headed by Allan Goldstein of George Washington University in Washington was the first.     Repligen Corp <RGEN> has said it plans to seek regulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine by the beginning of the summer. And Genentech Inc <GENE> has also said it plans to ask the FDA to approve human testing of its AIDS vaccine later this year.  Reuter &#3;
