SEC TO PROBE TWO CONVICTED OF SECURITIES FRAUD

The Securities and Exchange Commission said it began a disciplinary review of two men who were previously convicted of fraud for violations of  U.S. securities laws.     The SEC said Robert and Albert D'Elia were convicted following allegations that they traded upon information misappropriated from a financial printer in 1980 and 1981. The D'Elias were officers and shareholders of Rad Securities Inc, a Philadelphia broker-dealer.     A hearing will be scheduled at a later date, the SEC said.  Reuter &#3;
