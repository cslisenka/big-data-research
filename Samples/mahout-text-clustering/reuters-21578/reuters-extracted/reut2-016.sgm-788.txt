1 KILLED IN SEIZURE OF CANADIAN MISSIONARIES' LAND

Soldiers killed one man and seriously wounded several others as they barred a group of landless peasants from 120 acres of land seized from Canadian missionaries in northern Haiti, a source at the Cap Haitien church radio said.     The soldiers, acting yesterday on orders from the Haitian attorney general, had used tear gas and fired warning shots into the air prior to the shootings, the source said.     There was no official confirmation of the report.     Seven men who refused to leave the land were arrested after the shootings and would be tried, he said.     The source said the peasants, who are illiterate, had heard that Article 36 of Haiti's new constitution, ratified by popular referendum on March 29, allows for land seizures. In fact, the constitution forbids land seizures except as part of a court-sanctioned agrarian reform process.     The Canadian missionaries, the Sacred Heart Brothers, had bought the land from the state during the government of dictator Jean Claude Duvalier and had planted sugar cane on it, the source said.     "...the peasants are starving to death," the source told Reuters, "and they saw that the Canadians were working a large fertile property."  Reuter &#3;
