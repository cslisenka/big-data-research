NYSE TO STUDY REGULATION OF SECURITY INDUSTRY

The New York Stock Exchange said it will begin a review of regulation in the securities industry to determine what changes may be needed to maintain the integrity of the market and protect investors in coming years.     The Exchange said the study is needed because of the rapid changes taking place in the securities industry. Among the factors it cited were the increase in trading volume, the proliferation of new trading instruments and the rise of computerized trading techniques.     The Exchange did not mention, however, the insider trading scandal that has caught several top Wall Street executives.     The NYSE said its study will be chaired by Richard R. Shinn, executive vice chairman of the Exchange and former chairman and chief executive officer of <Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.>     Other members of the study committee include Charles F. Barbar, former chairman of Arsarco Inc <AR>, Roger Birk, chairman emeritus of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER> and Irwin Guttag, chairman of the NYSE special surveillance committee.     The committee's report should be completed by the end of the year, the Exchange said.  Reuter &#3;
