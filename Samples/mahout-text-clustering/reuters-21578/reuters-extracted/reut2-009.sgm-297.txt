CPC <CPC> EXPECTS EUROPEAN SALE TO CUT DEBT

CPC International Inc officials said the sale of the company's European corn wet milling business will remove about 700 mln dlrs of debt and liabilities from CPC's balance sheet.     They told analysts the deal, expected to close in September, and cash flow from other operations will reduced total debt by about one-third this year. At the end of 1986, CPC's debt totaled about 1.5 billion dlrs.     The officials also said the company has no current plans to sell its U.S. or North American corn wet milling businesses.     CPC's 1987 capital spending is budgeted at about 250 mln dlrs, down from about 361 mln dlrs last year, the officials told analysts.     They said the planned sale of the European corn wet milling business, which is subject to reaching a definitive agreement, will not result in much of change in this year's spending plans.     CPC is continuing to reduce corporate overhead costs by streamlining operations in Latin America, its technical laboratory operations in the U.S., and by completing the start up of a new plant in Argo, Ill., they added.
