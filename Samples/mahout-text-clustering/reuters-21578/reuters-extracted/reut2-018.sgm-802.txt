PAR <PAR> TO COMPETE WITH LILLY'S <ELI> KEFLEX

Par Pharmaceutical Inc said it will begin marketing a generic form of Eli Lilly and Co's  Keflex, a widely used antibiotic whose patent expired April 21, in about six weeks.     Generic drugs are cheaper copies of brand name drugs that have lost their patents.     Par said its generic form of Keflex, called Cephalexin, will be made by an overseas supplier so that Par will not have to make a substantial investment in a separate facility required to make the product.
