HUGHES <GMH>, RAYTHEON <RTN> TO SEEK NAVY WORK

General Motors Corp's <GM> Hughes Aircraft Co subsidiary and Raytheon Co said they formed a joint-venture partnership to compete for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Air-to-Air Missile program.     The two contractors said their teaming is in response to the Navy's March 20 request for proposals for the demonstration-validation phase of the program that called for contractor teaming.     The Hughes-Raytheon partnership is called H and R Co.     The Hughes-Raytheon statement said McDonnell Douglas Corp's <MD> McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co subsidiary will be the principal subcontractor to the partnership and will be responsible for the missile airframe design and propulsion.     Under the partnership, it said, Raytheon and Hughes will have equal responsibility for defining the overall missile system design and development.     Raytheon will have responsibility for the design of the radar guidance sybsystem and target detection device.     While Hughes will be responsible for overall guidance and missile integration, both companies will assume key roles in the integration of the overall missile with the Navy's many aircraft and weapons systems, the statement said.
