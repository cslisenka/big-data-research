COMEX COPPER FUTURES DROP LATE, SETTLE LOWER

Comex copper futures settled weaker after dropping to new session lows on trade selling, which entered a few minutes before the close, brokers said.     May delivery slipped to 62.05 cents before settling at 62.30 cents a lb, off 0.35 cent.     May's high was its opening price of 62.85 cents.     Indications that commission house selling would enter above that level kept a lid on the market, brokers said. Otherwise, dealings were featureless, they said.     The May/July backwardation settled at 25 points versus 30 points yesterday.  Reuter &#3;
