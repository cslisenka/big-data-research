NEW N.Z. POST OFFICE BANK TO GET CASH INJECTION

The new state-owned Post Office Bank Ltd (POB) will receive 135 mln dlrs from the government to boost its assets and will be capitalised at 300 mln dlrs of which 250 mln will be provided immediately, according to the agreement establishing the POB.     The agreement is the first to be finalised between the government and nine new state-owned corporations which start business at midnight.     It was announced in a joint statement by Finance Minister Roger Douglas, Postmaster General Jonathan Hunt and POB chairman Robin Congreve.     The POB will take over the former Post Office Savings Bank and the 135 mln dlr cash injection will match assets with liabilities.     POB director Bill Birnie told reporters that assets totalled 2.7 billion dlrs before the injection.     The ministers said the government will continue to guarantee existing liabilities and will extend its guarantee to new liabilities assumed before June 30, 1988.     Congreve said the POB will operate as a retail bank and most of its lending will be for housing.  REUTER &#3;
