WARD CRITICISES GUINNESS'S FEE COMPLAINT

Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> director Thomas Ward told a High Court hearing that the company's action against him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give the impression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg fee in connection with the Distillers Co Plc <DIST.L> takeover, the Press Association news agency reported.     In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinness had failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March had offered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, into an escrow account where it could only be touched under agreed circumstances.     Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt to belittle his services, the PA reported.     "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was, when considered out of context, admittedly very large."     But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of the target, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potential damage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised and the cost for all services - were not merely large but virtually unprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.     Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100 mln stg, he added.     Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement with Distillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bid costs, the PA reported.     Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer Peter Curry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end a temporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputed amount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying to recover.     Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7 billion stg battle during 1986. The U.K. Government is also probing the affair and has yet to report.  Reuter &#3;
