PHILIPS MEDICAL SETS RESEARCH PROGRAM

Philips Medical Systems Inc, a unit of (North American Philips Corp), said a research program is underway at seven medical centers aimed at producing a new standard of three-dimensional medical imaging systems.     The goal is to provide doctors with quicker and better diagnostic information about human organs. Current systems have limited functions and can examine body parts such as limbs or the skull but not functioning organs, according to a Philips Medical spokesman.     The two-year program involves equipment from Philips and three private companies: Cemax Inc, a Santa Clara, Calif., maker of three-dimensional computer graphics systems, Island Graphics Corp, a San Rafael, Calif., graphics software firm, and Pixar, also a San Rafael software concern.     Philips holds about 10 pct each of Cemax and Island Graphics, the spokesman said, and is the exclusive worldwide distributor of Cemax's 1500X computer graphics system.     Philips also has an original equipment manufacturer agreement with Pixar.     The institutions are Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., Emory University, Atlanta, Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Baltimore, Washington University Medical Center, St Louis, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., UCLA, Los Angeles, and the University of Alabama, Birmingham.
