AUDI OFFERS CASH INCENTIVE TO CURRENT OWNERS

Audi of America Inc said it introduced the "Audi Private Purchase Plan" in which it will offer 5,000 dlr purchase certificates exclusively to current owners of 1984-86 Audi 5000 vehicles.     It said owners must apply the certificates toward purchase or lease of any new 1987 Audi 5000 series vehicle.     The program will run between April 1 and June 30, and more than 150,000 certificates will be mailed.     A company spokesman said eligible owners need not trade in their old cars to take advantage of the offer.     He also said the scheme was not prompted by the fact that Audi had to recall thousands of its cars earlier this year to correct a possible defect that caused some of the cars to accelerate suddenly.
