LME ZINC MIDSESSION SLIGHTLY EASIER

LME zinc was quiet throughout the morning with very little dealing after some light trade selling on the pre-market, dealers said.     Three months delivery ended official ring dealings quoted at 454.50/455 stg a tonne, down around two stg from yesterday afternoon's kerb close.     The pre-market dollar based trade selling pushed three months down to a 730 dlrs equivalent but attracted no follow through selling and the price held at that level for the rest of the morning.
