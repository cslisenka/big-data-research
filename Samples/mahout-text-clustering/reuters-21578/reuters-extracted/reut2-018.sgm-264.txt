NO PROSPECT IN SIGHT OF EC BUDGET ACCORD

The European Community was set to plunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministers failed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in the near-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said.     As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks in Luxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accord amongst the trading bloc's 12 member states.     The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a deficit this year of at least five billion European Currency Units and could be forced to choose between massive spending cuts or bankruptcy.     It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5 billion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farm spending and falling revenues.     But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that there can be no extra cash for the Community this year and instead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbs two thirds of the EC budget.     "We have to make clear that expenses should be based on income," West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer told reporters.     "There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financing in the form of national contributions," he added.     A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of the budget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies, was also far from agreement, diplomats added.     The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany, would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for two months.     But poorer member states, which would have to borrow funds to cover the delay, complain the change in the system would unfairly impose too much of the burden on them.     The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early debate on the changeover in the farm payments system, further delaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentary sources said.
