LABOUR GROUP URGES SUPPORT FOR RAILWAY STRIKERS

South Africa's largest labour federation has issued a broad call to the country's trade union movement to support thousands of striking black railway workers and criticised the state-owned rail company for threatening to replace the strikers with whites.     Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), which claims a membership of over 600,000 workers, most of whom are black, urged labour unions to show solidarity with the striking railwaymen, adding that a key issue in the strike was the freedom of workers to join trade unions of their choice.     Naidoo criticised the government-run South African Transport Services (SATS) for refusing to recognise the South African Railway and Harbours Workers Union, which represents most of the strikers.     He also accused SATS of applying "racist labour policies," by threatening to replace the strikers and added that the corporation's decision had further "inflamed the dispute."     The strike began on March 14 when workers walked out following the railway company's refusal to go to formal arbitration talks over the dismissal of a train driver.     SATS says that some 13,000 workers are involved in the stoppage, but union leaders put the number of strikers closer to 18,000.     The Cosatu official said a number of its affiliate unions had resolved to "take solidarity action" and would inform South Africa's Labour Minister of their decision. He also urged the country's two largest employer groups, the Association of Chambers of Commerce and the Federated Chamber of Industries, to intervene to resolve the strike.  REUTER &#3;
