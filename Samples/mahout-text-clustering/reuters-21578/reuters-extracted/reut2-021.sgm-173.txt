EGYPT TO BUILD ROADS FOR UGANDA

Egypt has agreed to build two new roads in Uganda worth a total of 295 mln dlrs, Egyptian commercial attache Muhammud el Tahan said.     The two countries signed an agreement under which Egyptian companies will reconstruct the roads between Fort Portal and Bundibugyo near the Zaire border in western Uganda and between Kapchorwa and Swam near Mount Elgon in the east of the country, he told reporters. Uganda would repay the loan from Egypt 70 pct in unspecified barter goods and 30 pct in hard currency.     Egypt and Uganda are also discussing the possibility of Egyptian help for a project to grow wheat in Uganda, he added.  Reuter &#3;
