AMERICAN SAVINGS <AMSB> SEEKS STATE CHARTER

American Savings Bank F.S.B. said it applied for a state charter and it intends to change its depositor insurance coverage to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and to withdraw from coverage by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.     The savings bank also said state chartered institutions have broader banking powers and the conversion will be in the best interest of both shareholders and depositors.  Reuter &#3;
