EC FARM MINISTERS DISAGREE ON DIRECT INCOME AIDS

Plans to provide direct income aids for European Community (EC) small farmers to help them face deep cuts in guaranteed crop prices received a mixed reception from EC agriculture ministers, EC officials said.     The plans were discussed at an informal meeting of the ministers hosted in the village of Genval by the Council of Ministers' current chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker.     The EC Executive Commission has proposed that the richer member states be allowed to make direct payments to their farmers in special difficulties, while the EC itself would finance a similar scheme in the poorer EC countries.     However, EC officials said only the Netherlands and Luxembourg supported this idea at today's meeting, and France, Denmark and Belgium showed marked hostility to it.     French minister Francois Guillaume told reporters, "Farmers should not become recipients of public assistance -- their survival should be assured by price mechanisms and the market."     The officials said the ministers had not sought to resolve their more urgent differences over guaranteed farm prices for 1987/88 at this meeting.     The ministers will resume talks on the price fixing issue in Luxembourg on June 15.  Reuter &#3;
