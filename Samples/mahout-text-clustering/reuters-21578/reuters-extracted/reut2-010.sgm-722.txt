YUGOSLAVIA TO HELP PRODUCE NEW SOVIET AIRLINER

Yugoslavia said it has been asked to participate in the production of a new Soviet airliner -- the Ilyushin 114.     The official Tanjug news agency said this was decided at a meeting in Havana of officials of the Soviet-led trade group Comecon. Yugoslavia is a communist nonaligned state, belonging neither to the Warsaw Pact or the Western alliance, Nato, but it enjoys preferential trading status in Comecon.  Under the deal, Yugoslavia will produce several major parts, including the landing gear, for the new medium-range 80-passenger Ilyushin airliner, Tanjug said. No financial details were disclosed.
