MONTREAL EXCHANGE NAMES NEW PRESIDENT

The Montreal Exchange said it named Bruno Riverin, president of Quebec's Caisse centrale Desjardins, as its new president and chief executive officer.     Riverin replaces former exchange president Andre Saumier, who resigned in January to set up a brokerage firm.     Riverin's appointment is effective March 26, the exchange, Canada's second largest, said.     The Caisse central is the main investment arm of Quebec's huge credit union movement.  Reuter &#3;
