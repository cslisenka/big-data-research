CHIRAC SAYS 1988 BUDGET DEFICIT WILL BE LOWER

Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said the budget deficit next year will be reduced by about 15 billion francs, and the government's planned programme of 50 billion francs' tax cuts for 1987/88 will be implemented, a statement from the Prime Minister's office said.     The forecasts were contained in a letter of guidance to ministries to prepare for the 1988 budget to be voted by Parliament in autumn.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur plans to cut the 1988 budget deficit to around 115 billion francs from the forecast 1987 deficit of 129 billion, and to 100 billion francs in 1989.     Chirac's statement said that to achieve the twin aims of reducing the deficit and granting tax relief "a vigourous effort to contain spending will have to be made."     As in his letter to ministries last year, Chirac repeated the aim to reduce by 1.5 pct the number of civil servants except those in teaching or the security services.     Budgetary adjustments made by the various government ministries will collated by Balladur in mid-July, who will then present them to the Prime Minister.  REUTER &#3;
