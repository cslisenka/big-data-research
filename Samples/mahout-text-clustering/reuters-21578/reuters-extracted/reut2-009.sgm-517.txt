WORTHERN BANKING <WOR> IN AGREEMENT WITH FEDS

Worthern Banking Corp said it entered into a formal written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.     The corporation said it will submit written plans and reports on a regular basis to the Reserve Bank on several matters, including current and future dividend policy for the corporation and its affiliates.     It also will inform the Reserve Bank about retaining an independent management corporation to appoint a chairman of its board, and it will first get approval from the Reserve Bank before it takes on any more debt.     In addition, Worthern said it will report on its maintenance of adequate capital at the corporation and its  affiliate banks, its strategic business plan for the remainder of 1987 and 1988, and its improvement in the corporation's and certain non-banking affiliates' position with respect to certain assets previously subject to adverse classification.     In addition, Worthern will provide the Federal Reserve Ban with quarterly progress reports specifying the actions taken to secure compliance with the agreement together with quarterly balance sheets and income statements.     Separately, Worthern said its results of oeperations for the year ended Dec 31, 1986, previously announced Jan 29, 1987, would be revised to reflect additional loan and lease loss reserves and loan charge-offs, resulting in additional losses for that period.
