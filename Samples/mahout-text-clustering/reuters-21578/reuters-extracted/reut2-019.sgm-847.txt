U.S. LEADS JAPAN IN FINANCIAL FUTURES BUSINESS

U.S. firms are expected to enjoy the advantage of superior experience over their Japanese competitors in the new, promising business of bringing asset rich Japanese investors to the U.S. financial futures markets.     Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to start using overseas futures in currencies, bonds and stocks to help them manage their bulging foreign portfolios.     "U.S. investment banks are going to take advantage. We've been in the business for two decades, the Japanese have not," said Eugene Atkinson, president of Goldman, Sachs Japan Corp.         Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the new markets, but in fact participation so far has been slow, Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said.     Koichi Kane, Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities International, said, "They're still in a starting up period."     "They're testing the water," Atkinson added. But once they start, the Japanese are likely to become very big players, opening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.     U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start is understandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, are fairly new to the market.         Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., but because of the high risks involved American pension funds and mutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until relatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analyst said.     In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures, an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed for the slow start, the Japanese sources said.         Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domestic financial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers in Japan for overseas futures markets.     This may change next year, when bankers speculate that securities houses will be permitted to enter this line of business.     While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americans have moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc, Goldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and PainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.         In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc is preparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of Trade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for futures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.     Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yet decided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the U.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors and the U.S. futures markets, Kane said.     The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently to coincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increased Japanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issue is still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.         High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures market, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime trading session in Chicago if possible, they said.     The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and establishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizing clerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and Chicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.     Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from the securities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into the U.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.          One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions, which was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into the brokerage business, they said.     "The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or to go into a business tie-up," said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.     One trust bank source said total fees could amount to around one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets fully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.     Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively many foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth capital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be a different story, Japanese banking sources said.     They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to difficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.     In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S. brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13 dlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.     Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to approach Japanese financial institutions about possible tie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.     But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small capital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese nervous about a capital link.     Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage business once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts growing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.     But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanese government would let banks engage in this new risky business.  reuter &#3;
