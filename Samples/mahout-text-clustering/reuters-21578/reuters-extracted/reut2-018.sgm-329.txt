ABRAMS SAYS HE "HONEST BUT WRONG"

Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said he was "completely honest and completely wrong" when he gave assurances last October that the U .S. government was not involved in a flight by a contra supply plane downed over Nicaragua.     He was being questioned by the congressional Iran-contra panel about testimony he gave to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on October 15, 1986, saying no U.S. intelligence, defense or other government official was involved in the flight.     "I made those statements and I made a similar statement on October 14 to Secretary (of State George) Shultz. And every one of those statements was completely honest and completely wrong," Abrams testified.     Two of the crew of the downed aircraft, operating out of El Salvador, were killed. The third, Eugene Hasenfus, was captured, tried and sentenced to 30 years' jail, but later released by the Nicaraguan authorities.     Abrams -- the highest-ranking member of the administration to testify in five weeks of televised hearings -- said he did not remember how he learned that the plane had been shot down, but thought it was probably from the CIA.     He said he made public statements within a couple of days that there had been no U.S. government involvement after making inquiries of the CIA, the National Security Council and the Pentagon.     "Everybody said, not only then but later, that there was no U.S. government role," he said.  Reuter &#3;
