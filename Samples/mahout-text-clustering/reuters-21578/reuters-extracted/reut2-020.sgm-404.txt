AUDIO/VIDEO AFFILIATES <AVA> TO PURCHASE SHARES

Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it has authorized the purchase of up to 2.5 mln shares of its common stock, in market transactions, from time to time.     The company said the purchases were authorized because it believes the market price of the stock is less than its underlying value. Audio/Video said general funds of the company will be used to purchase the shares, and all shares will be held in the company's treasury, for possible future use.  Reuter &#3;
