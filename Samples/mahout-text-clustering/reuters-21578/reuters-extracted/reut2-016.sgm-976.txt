BUNDESBANK INTERVENES TO BUY DOLLARS AGAINST YEN

The Bundesbank intervened in the open market to buy dollars against yen, dealers said.     They were responding to enquiries immediately after news the Swiss National Bank said it joined concerted intervention to sell yen for dollars.     The Bundesbank had no immediate comment on the reports.     But dealers said the German central bank came into the market just after 1300 GMT when the dollar was trading around 141.90 yen to buy small amounts of the U.S. Currency. Dollar trading had been very quiet for most of the European session.  REUTER &#3;
