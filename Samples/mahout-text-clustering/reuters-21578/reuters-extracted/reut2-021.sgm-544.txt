BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS

The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in bills from its holdings on Tuesday to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 470 billion yen and recycle 400 billion in bills maturing then, money market traders said.     Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8512 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses through 29-day repurchase agreements maturing on November 17. These are aimed at meeting a projected cash shortage on that day, when the government floats 1.95 mln shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The other 400 billion will yield 3.9006 pct through 44-day repurchase accords maturing on December 2.     The operation will bring the supply of bills outstanding to about 3,200 billion yen.
