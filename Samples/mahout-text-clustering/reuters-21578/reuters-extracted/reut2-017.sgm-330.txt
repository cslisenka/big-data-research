BRUNSWICK <BC> NET GAINS DESPITE CHARGE

Brunswick Corp said its first-quarter sales and profits hit records despite an after-tax charge of about 10 mln dlrs from its new boat-building units.     The 10 mln dlrs charge, or 22 cts a share, was for amortization of intangible assets at Bayliner and Sea Ray, two boatmakers acquired in December, a spokesman told Reuters.     Earlier it said net profits for the period were 34.7 mln or 78 cts a share versus 23.8 mln or 57 cts a share a year ago. Its Mercury unit's first-quarter sales increased 26 pct and operating earnings rose 19 pct, while its industrial products unit operated at a slight loss, it said.  Reuter &#3;
