GERMAN TAX CUT BILL TO GO BEFORE CABINET APRIL 1

The West German Finance Ministry said the cabinet will discuss a bill on Wednesday to increase tax cuts by an extra 5.2 billion marks next year to a total of 13.7 billion marks.     The additional tax cuts were agreed within the government coalition in early March after Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg pledged at the six-nation monetary conference in Paris in February to increase the size of the 1988 tax cuts.     The bill will be presented in parliament at a later, unspecified date after the cabinet's deliberations.  REUTER &#3;
