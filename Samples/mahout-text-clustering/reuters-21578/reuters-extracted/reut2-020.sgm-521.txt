NEWSPAPER REPORTS REVISED UN PEACE PLAN DETAILS

U.N. Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is proposing a simultaneous ceasefire and inquiry into who started the Iran-Iraq war under a revised peace plan, an Arab newspaper reported on Tuesday.     The United Arab Emirates daily al-Khaleej published what it said was the text of his nine-point peace plan.     The Al-Khaleej text referred to a ceasefire date as D-day and stipulated, "On D-day, or another date to be agreed upon, an impartial body to enquire into responsibility for the conflict would start work." A choice could be made among existing bodies or an ad hoc body could be established, the text said.     The text also envisaged setting a deadline for the body to complete its work.  Reuter &#3;
