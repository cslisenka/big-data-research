WHITE HOUSE CHIEF HAS NO SECRET TAX PLAN

White House chief of staff Howard Baker said he has no secret plan to raise taxes.     Talking to reporters, he pointed out that, "Ronald Reagan is president. I am chief of staff. His program is my program." I have no tax plan at all."     Baker's comments came in response to a question as to whether he planned to support higher taxes to reduce the budget deficit. President Reagan has said repeatedly that he opposes higher taxes.   Reuter &#3;
