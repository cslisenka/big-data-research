SPRINKEL DENOUNCES PROTECTIONISM

Beryl Sprinkel, Chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors, denounced protectionism as a means of addressing the U.S.s' mounting trade imbalance and said stepped-up ecomonic growth would be a more effective means of reducing the deficit.     "Rather than risking the outbreak of protectionism we should strive to reduce trade restrictions and to promote a more open system of international trade," Sprinkel said.     Sprinkel, in a speech delivered to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, also said the budget deficit must be reduced through lower government spending in order to promote growth.  Reuter &#3;
