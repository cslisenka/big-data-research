GUINNESS SUES BOESKY IN FEDERAL COURT

<Guinness PLC> has joined investors suing former Wall Street speculator Ivan Boesky, alleging it was deceived into putting money into his one billion dlr investment partnership in 1986.     Guinness, the largest limited partner in Ivan F. Boeksy and Co. L.P., is the latest to file suit in federal court in Manhattan against Boesky, court papers show.     About 40 other investors have also filed suit over similar allegations, including that Boesky did not reveal his illegal insider trading activities.     Guinness is charging it was induced to join in the Boesky partnership through a prospectus that contained "material untrue statements and omissions."     The suit also alleged that the Boesky Corporation, which became a part in the formation of the investment partnership, Ivan F. Boesky and Co., L.P., "had achieved its extraordinary rates of return as a result of trading on inside information and other violations of the securities laws."     In addition, the suit charged that Boesky and other defendants unlawfully "schemed with and provided substantial assistance to one another to evade the registration provisions" of securities law.
