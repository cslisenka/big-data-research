NELSON TO EXPAND VIDEO VENDING

<Nelson Holdings International Ltd> said it plans to expand the marketing of its video vending machines, which have been tested successfully in Toronto.     The machines, which can contain up to 400 videocassettes, have been placed in convenience stores and gas stations for the past nine months.     Nelson said it now has machines in about 50 locations in Toronto and will expand its sales effort across Canada this year.     The vending machines allow customers to rent a videocassette, using a credit card, and return the cassette to the same machine.  Reuter &#3;
