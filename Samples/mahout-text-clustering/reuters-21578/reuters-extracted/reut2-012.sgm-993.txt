LARGER VOLUME SEEN ON EUROPEAN OPTIONS EXCHANGES

European options exchanges will see spectacular growth over the next five years as more and more professional investors discover the options markets, Bernard Reed, manager of the London options exchange said.     At an options outlook seminar to mark tomorrow's official opening of a new Amsterdam options exchange (EOE) building, he forecast increasing interest from banks and institutional investors, using options for portfolio insurance.     "But the dominance by the professionals should not make us neglect private clients," he noted. "Successful exploitation of retail business has been one of the keys to success."     Reed said that derived option products in particular will become a popular instrument for managing equity risks. On the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the cash-settled S&P 100 index option is the most traded in the world.     Dutch Stock Index Fund options to be relaunched on May 18 and the upcoming options on London's FTSE 100 index will see a 30 pct yearly turnover growth until 1990, Reed estimated.     The CBOE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have agreed with Morgan Stanley to trade options and futures on the capital international EAFE index which will let investors participate in worldwide market moves.     Reed said he did not believe in globalising the option business by introducing international products, because this would intensify competition among the exchanges, but he did see a future for global rules and regulations.
