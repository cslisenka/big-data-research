LAWSON SAYS LOW U.K. UNIT WAGE COSTS HELP EXPORTS

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports but wage rises are "faster than is comfortable."     He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises were wrong, saying OECD predictions "are somewhat unreliable."     "Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even though wages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unit cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said in answer to questions on BBC radio.     "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in export markets, for example, but we could do even better and get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate rate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added.     His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, up from March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Government bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.     Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the economy.     Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next budget due in March 1988.     "We will certainly achieve it sooner or later," he said.     The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unit wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct annually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2 pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct.     However, analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year.  REUTER &#3;
