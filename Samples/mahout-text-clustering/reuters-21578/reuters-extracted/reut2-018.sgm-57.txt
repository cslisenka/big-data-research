SHEARSON ECONOMIST SAYS VOLCKER EFFECT SHORT-TERM

Alan Sinai, chief economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said news that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker declined to accept reappointment would have only a short-term effect on financial markets.     "The markets should not go into a panic," Sinai told a fixed-income conference in New York sponsored by the Institute for International Research.     Sinai said he thought that Volcker was one of the best Fed governors in the country's history. Still, he predicted that the markets would calm after today's tremors.     Alan Greenspan has been nominated to replace Volcker.  Reuter &#3;
