SPANISH FARMERS BATTLE POLICE IN N.E. SPAIN

Thousands of Spanish farmers battled police in this northeastern city during a march to demand a better deal from the EC, protest organisers said.     The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings in Saragossa.     In the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more than 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets to protest against duties levied by the EC against their exports.     Spain joined the community in January last year and farmers say they have suffered competition from EC imports without sufficient compensation.  Reuter &#3;
