U.S., JAPAN CHIP TALKS TO START NEXT WEEK

U.S. and Japanese negotiators will hold emergency meetings next week to try to resolve their row over semiconductors, but a U.S. official said it was not likely the talks would delay the planned American sanctions.     Officials said the talks, which were announced yesterday by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, were being held under the emergency provisions of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.     A spokesman for Yeutter said officials of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) would hold technical talks with U.S. officials next Monday and Tuesday.     The spokesman said that on Thursday and Friday Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith would meet with MITI vice president Makoto Kuroda.  Reuter &#3;
