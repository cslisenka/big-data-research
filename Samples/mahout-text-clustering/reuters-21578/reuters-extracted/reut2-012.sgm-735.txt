LIBYA STILL BOMBING CHAD AIRSTRIP SAY FRENCH

Libyan forces are still bombing the key Ouadi Doum airstrip in northern Chad captured by Chadian troops on March 22, French Defence Minister Andre Giraud said.     The bombing was still going on even though Libyan troops had been driven out of most of northern Chad, Giraud told Radio France Internationale in an interview monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. He added Chad had not asked France to help drive the Libyans out of the north.     Chad said yesterday its troops had captured the Libyan outpost of Gouro, some 150 km south of the disputed Aouzou strip in the far north of the central African country.  REUTER &#3;
