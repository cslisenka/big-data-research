U.S. AID CHIEF TO BE NAMED TO TOP TREASURY POST

President Reagan will shortly nominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World development, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the Department of the Treasury, administration sources said.     They said the White House was expected to announce McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy Treasury scretary later this week.     The nomination is subject to Senate approval.     McPherson has headed the Agency for International Development (AID) since 1981. As Treasury Secretary James Baker's chief assistant, he would be expected to work closely on international economic policy, including the major problems of the Mexican and Brazilian debts.     McPherson, a lawyer, worked in the White House under President Gerald Ford, after serving as a corporate tax specialist for the Internal Revenue Service.     He also spent two years in Peru as a member of the Peace Corps.     Darman, who was considered to have played a central role in achieving agreements among industrial countries on international economic policy, will leave the Treasury on April 13 to join the Investment Banking Group of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
