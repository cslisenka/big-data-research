CHAD SAYS IT KILLED 384 LIBYANS IN BATTLE

Chadian troops killed 384 Libyans and captured 48 in fighting near the key Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum in northern Chad, a Chadian government statement said.     The statement issued by Chad's Paris embassy said government troops had "completely annihilated" a Libyan column yesterday some 45 km (28 miles) from the Libyan base.     It was the highest number of Libyan casualties reported since January 2, when Chadian troops overran an important garrison at the oasis of Fada with the loss of more than 700 Libyan troops.     Ouadi Doumi, central northern Chad, is the site of Libya's main airfield in the country and several clashes have been reported over the past week in the surrounding desert between troops loyal to President Hissene Habre and Libyan forces.
