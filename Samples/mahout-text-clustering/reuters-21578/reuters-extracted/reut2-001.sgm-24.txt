AERO SERVICES <AEROE> GETS NASDAQ EXCEPTION

Aero Services Inc said its common stock will continue to be included for quotation in the National Association of Securities Dealers' NASDAQ system due to an exception from filing requiements, which it failed to meet as of January 15.     The company said while it believes it can meet conditions the NASD imposed for the exception, there can be no assurance that it will do so.  Reuter &#3;
