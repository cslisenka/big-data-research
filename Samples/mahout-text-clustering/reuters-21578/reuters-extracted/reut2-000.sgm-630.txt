PACCAR <PCAR> AND UNIT DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded to A-plus from AA-minus about 350 mln dlrs of senior debt of PACCAR Inc and its unit PACCAR Financial Corp.     S and P said PACCAR has experienced earnings weakness. But the company remains profitable and should achieve significant cost reductions from its recent shut down of two assembly plants, S and P noted.     The rating agency pointed out that price discounting has eroded some of PACCAR's pricing advantage in the premium, custom-built segment of the trucking industry, which is PACCAR's traditional market niche.
