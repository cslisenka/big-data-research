MEXICO REJECTS CALLS TO REPRIVATISE BANKS

Senior officials from government and the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) rejected business sector calls this week to reprivatise the 26 Mexican banks, nationalised five years ago.     PRI president Jorge de la Vega, speaking in Saltillo, Coahuila state, said the party would never permit reprivatisation "because the banks belong to all Mexicans."     Speaking in Hermosillo, Sonora State, Deputy Finance Minister Francisco Suarez Davila said the nationalised banks have proved a positive instrument through which the government has been able to promote economic development.     Suarez davila said that in the hands of the state, banks have performed well and that the government will adopt whatever reorganization is needed to improve efficiency.     Earlier this week, the newly elected head of the powerful business coordinating council, agustin legorreta, called for the banks to be reprivatized, charging that competition and efficiency had been eroded.     Then president jose lopez portillo nationalised the banks in 1982, accusing them of aiding capital flight. Later that year, miguel de la madrid took office and announced a scheme to offer 34 pct of the banks' shares to the public.  Reuter &#3;
