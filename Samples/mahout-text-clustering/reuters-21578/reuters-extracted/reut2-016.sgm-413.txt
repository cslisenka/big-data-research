TEXACO NETHERLANDS UNAFFECTED BY CHAPTER 11 FILING

Texaco Petroleum Maatschaapij (Netherlands) BV said its operations were unaffected by yesterday's move by Texaco Inc <TX.N> to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.     A Texaco spokesman said the Dutch unit, wholly owned by Texaco Inc through holding companies, had its own financial relationship with banks, its own distribution facilities and refinery, and bought its own crude oil and products.     There had been no negative reaction from trading partners to the U.S. Move, although there was some negative influence on publicity, he said.     "The Dutch operations are not dependent on the U.S. For money or products. We are informing our customers that our business is not affected in any way," the spokesman said.     He said trading partners had not made demands for stricter credit terms than was normal in the international oil markets.     Spot market traders at Dutch arms of other major companies said they were acting as usual towards Texaco so far, but some were maintaining contact with their headquarters' credit control offices. One trader said his company hoped to meet representatives of Texaco personally to clarify the position.  Reuter &#3;
