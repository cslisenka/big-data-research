PEGA TO BUY STAKE IN TAMPER-PROOF PACKAGING

Pega Capital Resources Ltd <PGA.TO> said it agreed in principle to acquire a 50 pct undivided interest in all rights and patents to a tamper resistant and tamper-evident packaging process for 1,250,000 dlrs.     The company said the purchase price is payable in 1,250,000 common shares priced at one dlr each. The shares will be paid under an escrow agreement where Pega may terminate the purchase agreement and cancel the shares up to October 31, 1987.     It said the process results in readily visible breakage if packaging material is pierced by a sharp object.  Reuter &#3;
