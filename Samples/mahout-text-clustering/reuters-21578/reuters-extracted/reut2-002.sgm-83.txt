MORTON-THIOKOL <MTI> LISTS ON S AND P 500

Morton-Thiokol Corp will be included in Standard and Poor's 500 Stock index, effective today, Standard and Poor's Corp said.     Trading in Morton-Thiokol stock opened up 4-1/4 at 50 on turnover of 122,700 shares after a delayed opening due to an imbalance of orders.     There are certain funds which base their portfolio on the 500 stocks listed on the index, and the imbalance of orders reflects those managers adding shares of Morton-Thiokol, Standard and Poor's said.     Adding Morton-Thiokol's stock to the 500 index list is a "minor positive development," analyst Martin Ziegler said, noting that it brings in new buyers for the shares and gives the company a higher profile.     James Arenson at DLJ Securities agreed that inclusion on the index automatically creates new buyers and noted it also allows those portfolio managers who could not buy the stock to purchase shares.     While Morton-Thiokol's stock opened up much higher, it gave back some of its gains and is currently trading at 47-3/8, up 1-5/8, a pattern termed, by one analyst, as "typical" when a company is newly added.
