TROUND INTERNATIONAL <TROU> IN JOINT VENTURE

Tround International Inc said it entered into a joint agreement with <Lucas Aerospace Ltd>.     The company said the agreement calls for the selection of certain Tround products for use both with the Lucas 50 caliber gun turret on helicopters and other vehicles and to establish a sales effort for these products.     The two companies are negotiating with the U.S. Navy to flight-qualify the joint system, which will be adapted to a helicopter provided by the Navy.     Tround said the system has the potential for revenues in excess of 300 mln dlrs over a six-to-eight-year production time span, assuming the project is a success.  Reuter &#3;
