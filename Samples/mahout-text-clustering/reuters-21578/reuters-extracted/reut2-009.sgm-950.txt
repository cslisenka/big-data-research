FRANK B. HALL <FBH> DEBT MAY BE CUT BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade about 65 mln dlrs of Frank B. Hall and Co Inc's B-1 subordinated notes.     Moody's said its focus will be on Hall's brokerage business and contingent liabilities associated with the unit Union Indemnity Insurance Co.     The agency cited a 140 mln dlr lawsuit by the New York State Insurance Department against Hall in connection with the insolvency of the Union Indemnity subsidiary, which was liquidated by New York Insurance in 1985.
