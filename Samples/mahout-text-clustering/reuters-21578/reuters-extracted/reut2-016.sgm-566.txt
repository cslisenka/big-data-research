U.S. OFFICIALS SAY NO PROGRESS ON JAPAN DISPUTE

White House officials said no progress had been made in talks with Japan on a dispute on Japanese microchip sales.     President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci told reporters "it looks like a very difficult situation at this point."     The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the U.S. and failure to open its own market to U.S. goods.     White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that talks with the Japanese had failed to provide any reason to prevent the publication of a proclamation on Friday putting the new duties in effect.     "I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday," Baker said. Carlucci said that the evidence of Japanese microchip dumping at below production costs in third countries had been fairly conclusive. He said that in U.S.-Japanese talks that concluded last Friday, Japanese officials presented statistics to show that Japan had made its market more open to American products.     "Our statistics do not confirm this, indeed they tend to go in the other direction," Carlucci said.     Baker and Carlucci appeared before White House reporters as Reagan enjoyed a vacation at his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara.  Reuter &#3;
