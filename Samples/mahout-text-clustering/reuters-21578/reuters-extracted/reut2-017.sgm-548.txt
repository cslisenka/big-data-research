HOLDERBANK EXPECTS 1987 RESULTS TO BE STEADY

Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG <HOLZ.G> expects its 1987 results to be at least steady, with increases in volume sales and negative currency factors roughly cancelling each other out, deputy chairman Max Amstutz said.     He told a news conference that turnover was likely to rise 20 pct in volume terms, partly through the consolidation of recently acquired companies. Ideal Basic Industries Inc <IDL> of the U.S., Which Holderbank agreed last year to acquire, should boost group sales by around 12 pct.     But the weakness of the dollar -- the key currency for the group -- would remain a strong negative factor.     Holderbank earlier reported consolidated 1986 net profit of 239 mln Swiss francs compared with 126 mln in 1985 on sales which fell to 3.3 billion francs from 3.6 billion.     Group president Thomas Schmidheiny said Holderbank was now in a consolidation phase after 15 years of enormous growth.     Priority would be given to strengthening its existing positions and to integrating recent acquisitions but the group would continue to take advantage of new opportunities for acquisitions.
