COMEX SILVER FUTURES SOAR AT OPENING

Comex silver futures opened 15 to 18 cents higher and then retreated slightly as followthrough buying slowed.     May was up 12.5 cents at 6.705 dlrs from a high of 6.75 dlrs. July was up 13.1 cents at 6.785 dlrs from 6.84 dlrs.     Traders said large commission houses were buyers on the open but encountered profit-taking and a slowdown in orders.     Some traders said the market is starting to look overbought technically and vulnerable to a correction.     But they added that speculators continue to view the market as a good buy relative to gold.  Reuter &#3;
