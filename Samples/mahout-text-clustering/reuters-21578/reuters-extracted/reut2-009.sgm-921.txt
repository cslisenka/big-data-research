REUTERS TO CARRY SEAQ TWO-WAY U.K. SHARE QUOTES

Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> said it had reached agreement with the London-based International Stock Exchange on the distribution of two-way British domestic share quotations from the Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System (SEAQ) via the Reuter worldwide information network.     The company said in a statement the agreement covered SEAQ Level-2, which provides buy and sell price quotations from 31 individual market makers in domestic U.K. Equities.     Reuters said it will begin carrying the quotes for all 101 Alpha stocks, leading U.K. Shares, within the next few weeks.     The SEAQ investor service, which displays indications of market prices for U.K. Shares without identifying market makers, has been available on the Reuter network since the "Big Bang" deregulation of the London stock market last October.     The SEAQ level-2 service will be available on one-month trial to subscribers to the Reuter International Equities Service and to the Reuter U.K. Investment Service, prior to the imposition of Stock Exchange fees, the company said.
