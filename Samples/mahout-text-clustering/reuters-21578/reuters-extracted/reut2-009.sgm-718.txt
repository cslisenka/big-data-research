SRI LANKA TO LAUNCH APPEAL FOR DROUGHT AID

Sri Lanka will appeal to its major aid donors for at least 21 mln dlrs in financial support to help it overcome the country's worst drought in 26 years.     Government officials told Reuters that letters detailing the extent of the drought would be sent this week to the 14 countries that gave some 700 mln dlrs in development aid to Sri Lanka last year. These include Australia, Canada, Japan, Britain, the U.S. And West Germany.     Officials in the Finance and Planning Ministry coordinating the aid request said Sri Lanka wanted the money over a six-month period.     Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando last week briefed representatives of aid-donor countries and international relief agencies on the drought and made a general appeal for help.     The state had disbursed 800,000 dlrs by February for the most badly affected districts, but the Finance and Planning Ministry officials said no further relief was available from the budget.
