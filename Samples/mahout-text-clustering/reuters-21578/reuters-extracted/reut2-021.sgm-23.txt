FIRST BOSTON <FBC> STRATEGIC REVIEW IS UNDERWAY

First Boston Inc said it is conducting a strategic review of its operations as part of a general policy to periodically evaluate its business plans.     The company said it is too early to predict the outcome of the review, although it does not expect radical changes in its organization.     Salomon Inc <SB> last week completed a strategic review that resulted in substantial layoffs.     Other brokerage firms are either engaged in reviews or have made major personnel cutbacks.
