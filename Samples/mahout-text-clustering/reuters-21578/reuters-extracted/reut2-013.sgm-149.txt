ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS RESEARCH TAX CREDIT IDEA

Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Mentz said the administration supported continuing a tax credit for business research expenses after the current 20 pct credit expires at the end of next year.     Mentz, in testimony before the Senate Finance subcommittee on taxation, said the administration was not ready yet to make a recommendation to Congress on the appropriate structure, rate or duration of the credit.     The subcommittee is considering a plan to make the credit permanent and raise it to 25 pct.  Reuter &#3;
