SOUTHERN UNIT <SO> RATINGS AFFIRMED BY MOODY'S

Moody's Investors Services Inc said it affirmed the ratings on 5.3 billion dlrs of debt of Georgia Power Co, a unit of The Southern Co.     Affirmed were the Baa-1 first mortgage bonds, secured pollution control revenue bonds and cumulative preferred stock, and the Baa-2 unsecured pollution control revenue bonds.     Moody's said, however, that it may review the company's debt ratings pending a rate decision by the Georgia Public Service Commission due by October. If the rate order is unconstructive, Moody's review would have negative implications at that time, the agency noted.  Reuter &#3;
