BP <BP> ADR'S TO REPRESENT MORE ORDINARY SHARES

British Petroleum Co Plc's proposed capitalization share issue, announced earlier today in London, will result in each of the company's ADRs representing 12 ordinary shares, up from the current four, a BP North America Inc spokesman said.     He explained that the proposed capitalization share issue, which is subject to the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting to be held April 30, immediately following the annual general meeting, is effectively a three-for-one stock split.
