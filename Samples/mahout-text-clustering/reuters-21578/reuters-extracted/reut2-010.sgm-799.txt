EC MINISTERS STUDY FARM PRICES, NO ACCORD SEEN

European Community agriculture ministers are today taking their first serious look at farm price proposals for the coming season, but diplomats expect no agreement at the two days of talks.     Experts say the proposals put forward last month by the European Commission could lead to a double-digit percentage fall in guaranteed prices for the 1987/88 crop year.     Consideration of the price measures comes as farm surpluses and subsidies are set to dominate forthcoming talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     The talks signal the official start of months of annual wrangling over subsidy levels paid to the EC's 12 mln farmers.     Agriculture worldwide is plagued by surplus production and depressed prices, with domestic economic policies largely blamed for the crisis. The U.S. Has signaled it wants the issue of world over-supply pushed to the top of the list of international economic issues to be negotiated this year.     EC diplomats say that to a large extent this view is shared in Europe, but the political strength of well-organised farm lobbies leaves ministers with little room for manoeuvre.  Reuter &#3;
