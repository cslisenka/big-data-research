AIRBUS SAID READY TO COOPERATE WITH MCDONNELL <MD>

The European Airbus consortium is ready to cooperate with U.S. Aerospace group McDonnell Douglas Corp on future aircraft programs, pointing the way to a defusion of the transatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry, French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said.     He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in an interview today that the talks between senior U.S. And European Community officials in London on October 27 on the Airbus question should be more harmonious as a result.        Airbus officials said last week that they were continuing talks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas on aircraft projects, including an eventual stretched version of the Airbus A320 short-haul jet, but that collaboration in the immediate future was unlikely.     U.S. Manufacturers and officials have charged that the French, British and West German governments have disrupted the world aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus, allowing it to undercut private U.S. Competitors, while the Europeans have responded by saying that U.S. Manufacturers benefit from large government-funded military contracts.     Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was already widespread in aircraft construction.     Reuter &#3;
