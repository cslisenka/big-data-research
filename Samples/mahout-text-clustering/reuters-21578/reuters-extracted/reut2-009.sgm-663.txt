BANK BOARD TAKES CONTROL OF FLORIDA THRIFT

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it took control of the South Florida Banks and transferred its assets and deposits to a newly chartered federal mutual association.     The Bank Board said it approved a new five-member board for the association. South Florida was a state chartered stock institution with 175.2 mln dlrs in assets.     The Bank Board said the savings bank suffered from poorly underwritten loans and investments plus a high cost of funds and operating expenses, including excessive compensation of some former officers.
