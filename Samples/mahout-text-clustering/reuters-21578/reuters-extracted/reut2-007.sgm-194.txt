PACIFIC TELESIS <PAC> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION

The stock of Pacific Telesis Group rose 1/2 to 54-1/8 in active trading after analyst Charles Schelke of Smith Barney upgraded a recommendation on the stock to "buy" from "accumulate," traders said.     Schelke was unavailable for comment.     Traders familiar with the opinion said the recommendation noted that a possible operating rate reduction had already been discounted in the stock yesterday when it fell 1-7/8, making the stock a good buy today.
