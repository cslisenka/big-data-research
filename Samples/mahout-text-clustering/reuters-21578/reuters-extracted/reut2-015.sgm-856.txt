Salomon said the rumors affected the company's stock and  are "unequivocally denied."     The Salomon share price was off 5/8 at 37-1/2, but it had been off more than one dlr on heavy volume earlier in the day.     Analysts said the rumors have been circulating in the market for several days.         Salomon said the firm will report first quarter results on April 22 or 23.     Analysts said the stock would have reacted poorly today, even without the rumors, because of the decline in the stock and bond markets.     Other brokerages were also down today. E.F.
