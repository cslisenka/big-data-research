GOLDMAN SACHS DENIES RUMOURS OF SOLVENCY PROBLEM

<Goldman Sachs and Co> is not facing severe financial problems and has not filed for protection under U.S. Bankruptcy laws, Robert Conway, managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp said.     He was responding to a Reuter enquiry about rumours in London financial markets that the firm was in financial trouble.     "There is absolutely, positively no truth to those rumours," he said noting that in the current financial environment rumours like this are bound to surface.     Conway said that Goldman Sachs has had an excellent year and that it has a strong balance sheet and good liquidity.     "You can't be in the equity market as we are and not experience some problems after a day like yesterday (when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 508 points). But we are not facing any severe financial problems," he added.  REUTER &#3;
