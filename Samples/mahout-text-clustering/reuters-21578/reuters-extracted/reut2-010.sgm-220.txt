PHLCORP <PHX> SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED DIRECTORS

Shareholders of PHLCORP Inc, formerly Baldwin-United Corp, nominated Leucadia National Corp's slate of directors and adopted a proposal to reincorporate the company in Pennsylvania, according to PHLCORP's secretary and general counsel Bob Beber.     Elected to the board were Leucadia Chairman Ian Cumming, Leucadia President Joseph Steinberg, James Kimball and Michael Lynch.     PHLCORP previously said the planned reincorporation to Pennsylvania from Delaware results in certain limited restrictions on the transfer of company's shares, which are intended to minimize the likelihood of loss of significant tax benefits.     PHLCORP earlier said that on November 14, 1986, Leucadia acquired claims in Baldwin-United's bankruptcy proceedings entitling it to about 39 pct of the outstanding common of PHLCORP. Cumming and Steinberg were elected to the board in November.     Leucadia's candidates were the only nominated for the board. PHLCORP had said if the candidates did not win shareholder approval at the meeting in Philadelphia today, the former directors would continue in office.     PHLCORP has been managed by Palmieri Co, which was retained to assume management control of the company by Baldwin's former board of directors in May, 1983.     Leucadia had previously said if its directors won approval, the agreement with Palmieri would be terminated and Cumming and Steinberg would step in as chairman and president, respectively. PHLCORP will merge into a newly formed Pennsylvania company. Shares will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.  Reuter &#3;
