BCI HOLDINGS GETS CONSENT FOR STOCK DISTRIBUTION

BCI Holdings Corp said holders of a majority of its debt securities approved an amendment consenting to a distribution of certain assets of the company, clearing the way for BCI's planned reorganization.     Under the previously approved reorganization, BCI will be divided into two companies, including a newly-formed, publicly held non-food company, E-II Holdings Inc. BCI Holdings, which acquired Beatrice Cos Inc in April 1986, will remain a privately-held, primarily food company.     Consent of the debt securities holders was necessary to distribtute shares of E-II common stock plus 57.4 cts a share to BCI shareholders and warrant holders, BCI said. Shares will be distributed when a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective.     Holders of 11 pct Ten Year Senior Notes who consented to the amendments will receive 12.50 dlrs in cash for each 1,000 dlrs principal amount of debt securities. Consenting holders of the other three issues of debt securities will receive 10 dlrs in cash per 1,000 dlrs principal amount, BCI said. Total principal amount outstanding is 2.5 billion dlrs.
