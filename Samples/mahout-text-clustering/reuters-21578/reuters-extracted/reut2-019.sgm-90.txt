EC FARM MINISTERS MEETING UNLIKELY NEXT WEEK

A meeting of European Community (EC) farm ministers is unlikely to be held next week following the ministers' failure to agree a 1987/88 farm price package yesterday, an EC Commission spokesman said.     However, he said he could not rule out such a meeting altogether, noting the decision is one for Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers.     The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and 30, diplomats noted.     The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key aspects of EC Commission proposals, the actual common price changes and a revision of the "green money" system.     The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to appear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days giving notice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measures from July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord.     However, Commission sources said this notice would not detail the measures to be taken, which, they said, might be considered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting next Wednesday.     The Commission published a declaration by EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg early yesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting.     In it, Andriessen said there was now a serious threat to the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy.     Andriessen added ,"The Commission...Will take the measures which are necessary, not only for the temporary management of the markets, but also for a healthy finance policy."     "This means that the protective measures we are going to apply will necessarily have, in the context of our own powers, a dynamic character," he said.  REUTER &#3;
