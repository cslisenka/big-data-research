FINNISH JOBLESS RATE UNCHANGED UNDER NEW SYSTEM

Finnish unemployment was 6.9 pct in January after 6.9 pct in December and 6.8 pct in January last year according to the revised formula of the Central Statistics Office.     It said in a statement 173,000 were unemployed in January and December against 158,000 in January 1986.     The new formula shows unemployed persons willing to work if jobs were available but excludes any coming under the country's unemployment pension scheme.  REUTER &#3;
