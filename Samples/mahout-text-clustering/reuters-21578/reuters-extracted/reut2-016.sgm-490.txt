TURKEY SEEN UNLIKELY TO JOIN EC THIS CENTURY

Turkey, which tomorrow will formally apply to join the European Community, faces major obstacles in its bid and is unlikely to become the bloc's 13th member before the year 2,000, EC officials said.     Turkey's move comes as no surprise, but some officials said the application from a relatively poor country with most of its territory in Asia rather than Europe was likely to spark a long process of soul-searching among the EC's current members about what kind of European Community they wanted in the long term.     Officials echoed the view of diplomats in Ankara that Turkey's move put the EC in the dilemma of wanting to make clear it values Ankara as an ally in the NATO alliance, but sees huge problems in accepting it as a fellow EC member.     They said industrialised Community members have tried to dissuade Turkey from making the long-discussed formal application until the EC had had more time to digest the accession of Spain and Portugal last year.     Several also feel Ankara and the EC should first fully implement a 23-year-old association agreement between them before Turkey becomes a full member.  REUTER &#3;
