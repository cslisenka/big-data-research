COMBUSTION ENGINEERING <CSP> GETS THAI ORDER

Combustion Engineering Inc said the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has exercised an option to purchase a 300 megawatt coal-fired steam generator from CEMAR, a consortium of Combustion Engineering Canada Inc and Japan's Marubeni Corp.     Combustion Engineering said the project is valued at about 30 mln dlrs.     The new steam generator, which will burn local lignite, will be manufactured in Canada and installed as Unit Nine at the Mae Moh power station in Lampang, Thailand. The unit is expected to go into commercial operation in 1990.  Reuter &#3;
