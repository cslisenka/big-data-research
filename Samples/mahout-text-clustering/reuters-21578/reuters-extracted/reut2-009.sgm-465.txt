UK POLL SHOWS SURGE FOR CENTRIST ALLIANCE PARTIES

A British voter opinion poll in tomorrow's Today newspaper shows a surge in support for the centrist Alliance grouping and a fall for both the ruling Conservatives and the Labour opposition party.     The Marplan poll gives the Conservatives 36 pct, the Liberal/Social Democratic Alliance 31 pct, and Labour 31 pct as well. A Marplan survey last month gave the Tories 38 pct, the Alliance 21 pct, and Labour 37 pct.     The latest poll would, if translated into an election result, produce a hung parliament, analysts said. That should dampen speculation of an early June election, they added.  Reuter &#3;
