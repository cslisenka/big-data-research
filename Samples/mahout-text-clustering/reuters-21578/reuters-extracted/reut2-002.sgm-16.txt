STOP AND SHOP'S <SHP> BRADLEES FEBRUARY SALES UP

Stop and Shop Cos Inc said sales for the four weeks ended February 28 for its Bradlees Discount Department Stores Division were up six pct to 104 mln dlrs from 98 mln dlrs a year before, with same-store sales up three pct.      The company said the modest comparable store sales increase was due to a combination of difficult weather conditions in the Northeast, a later Easter this year and a possible slowing in consumer demand.
