MOBIL <MOB> REORGANIZES U.S. EXPLORATION, OUTPUT

Mobil Oil Corp said it is reorganizing its U.S. exploration and producing operations into a single affiliate, Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc, to be headquartered in Dallas, effective April one.     The Mobil Corp subsidiary said the operations are presently run from three affiliates located in Denver, New Orleans and Houston.     It said about 300 employees will be relocated to Dallas, adding these will be primarily in management, administrative and staff functions.     Mobil Oil said most technical and field operating people will remain at their current locations but some staff functions will be reduced.     Spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the impact of any reductions.     The company said the new affiliate will comprise four producing divisions and six exploration divisions. Four of the exploration divisions will be located with producing divisions in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, and Midland, Texas. The remaining two will be in Oklahoma City and Bakersfield, Calif.     Mobil Oil said the reorganization will "enhance our profitability" by emphasizing technology and improved communications, adding it will be able to respond quickly to changes in business environment.     The company said C.E. Spruell, now vice president, international producing operations, has been appointed president and general manager of the new affiliate.  Reuter &#3;
