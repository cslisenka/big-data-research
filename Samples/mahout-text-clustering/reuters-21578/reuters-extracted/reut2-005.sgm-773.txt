CONSERVATIVES MAKE MAJOR GAINS IN FINNISH POLLS

Finland's Conservatives emerged with major general election gains after a swing away from the left.     Conservative Party leader Ilkka Suominen told reporters "they can't keep us out of government now" after the Party gained nine Parliamentary seats in elections held on Sunday and Monday, taking its total to 53 seats.     With 99 pct of votes counted, Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa's Social Democratic Party had lost just one seat despite a 2.5 pct drop in support.     The Social Democrats held 57 seats in the last 200-seat parliament, the Conservatives 44 and the Centre Party 37.     It may take weeks for the political complexion of the new government to take shape as major parties negotiate to see which grouping can form a majority. But the result is expected to be a change from the outgoing centre-left coalition.     Political commentators said the results will have far-reaching implications as they showed a significant swing from the left, which has dominated post-war Finnish politics.     Despite the Conservative revival, commentators said there would be no immediate change in foreign policy, which is moulded by Finland's sensitive position in the shadow of the neighbouring Soviet Union.     The environmentalist "Greens" doubled their seats in parliament to four, although opinion polls had forecast they would win 10.     The Communists split for the first time into pro-Moscow Stalinists and Eurocommunists. The Eurocommunists retained their 17 seats, while the Stalinists, expelled from the official Communist Party in 1986, lost six of their 10 seats.  REUTER &#3;
