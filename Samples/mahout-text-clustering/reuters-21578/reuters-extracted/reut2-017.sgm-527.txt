TEXACO <QTX> SUPPOPTS BOND AND LIEN RULES STUDY

Texaco Inc <QTX> said it will support the efforts of a Texas legislature joint committee, which will study and propose remedies for problems with the procedural bond and lien rules of the Texas judiciary.     The rules, which require a defendant in a civil case to post a bond in the full amount of the judgment plus interest in order to exercise its right to appeal the judgment, directly led to Texaco to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, Texaco said.         Texaco said it was unfortunate that it took its bankruptcy to illustrate the need for reform.     Texaco also said Pennzoil Co's <PZL> obstructive tactics prevented similar legislation earlier in the legislature's session, which would have provided the trial judge in Texas flexibility to set the bond at a level appropriate to secure the interest of the judgment creditor based on the circumstances of the case.     Under current law, Texaco said it would have had to post the full 11.1 billion dlrs to exercise its right to appeal the judgment.  Reuter &#3;
