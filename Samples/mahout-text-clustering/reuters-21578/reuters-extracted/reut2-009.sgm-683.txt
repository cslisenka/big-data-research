U.S. BANKS SEEN STEPPING UP SECURITIES ROLE

The Glass-Steagall Act separating banking and securities activities in the U.S. is all but dead following decisions by federal and state authorities, the chairman of Bankers Trust Co asserted.     "There are plainly nails in the coffin of Glass-Steagall," Alfred Brittain said in remarks prepared for delivery to a meeting of bank and financial analysts.     He noted the Federal Reserve Board is due to decide Bankers Trust's application for a subsidiary that can underwrite certain securities.     Brittain said New York State bank regulators have welcomed applications for affiliates of New York-chartered banks which could underwrite corporate securities. And he said a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Bankers Trust's commercial paper business.     He said eventually the financial services industry will see fewer but bigger companies drawn from the ranks of the present commercial banks, investment banks and conglomerates.     On another topic, Britain called for a redefinition of the role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.     "I think we should return to the original purpose of FDIC insurance -- to protect small despositors and not depository institutions themselves," Brittain said.     He suggested banks be permitted to offer both insured deposits and uninsured deposits. High quality assets would be segregated to back up insured deposits.     He said big banks could then fail without draining the insurance funds. "Stockholders could be wiped out, management rmemoved and uninsured creditors could take their fair share of any losses," he said. But insured deposits under 100,000 dlrs would be protected.
