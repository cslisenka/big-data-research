UK TO RETAIN POWERS AGAINST U.S UNITARY TAXATION

Britain has decided to resist U.S. pressure and retain powers to withdraw tax credits from U.S. parent companies based in states which impose unitary taxes on the worldwide profits of foreign-owned firms, Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont told Parliament.     But he added that the eventual use of those powers would not be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.     The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use of unitary taxation of international business on grounds they are contrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down by the United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.     In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said "in the meantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitary tax issues will be kept under careful review" by Britain.     "Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December 31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the date of the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to take action thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or before December 31, 1988," Lamont said.     The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation late in 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profits made inside the U.S., Known as the "water's edge" method.     In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed to defer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985 - but only on the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitary tax issue would be made law and take effect from end-December 1986.     Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that it had decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of the passing of legislation in California.     Britain, however, considers the California legislation unsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have to pay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitary tax method, government sources said.
