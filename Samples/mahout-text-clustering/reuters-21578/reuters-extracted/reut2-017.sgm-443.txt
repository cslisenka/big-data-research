EC URGED TO ACT QUICKLY ON EUROPEAN AIRFARE CUTS

The European Commission should make urgent and concrete proposals to break the deadlock over moves to cut sky-high European airfares, an independent report said.     The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) said costs, fares and profits on international services within Europe are the highest in the world although European airlines are less efficient and not perceptibly safer than their cheaper U.S. Equivalents.     "The European airlines protect their position through the secrecy they maintain over the costs and profits of any group of services," the report said.     The airlines also protect themselves through "the ferocity with which (they) resist any relaxation of the monopolistic practices which protect their profits," the report said.     Britain, a strong advocate of deregulation, has been trying to push measures to introduce greater competition among Europe's airlines but negotiations foundered at the end of 1986 over discount and deep discount fares.     The IEA report said European governments and the Commission, the EC executive authority, had been extraordinarily lax about the airlines' secretiveness, showing "a lack of concern for the interests of the traveller."
