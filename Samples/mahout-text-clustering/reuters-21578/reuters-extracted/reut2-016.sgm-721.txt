DRESSER INDUSTRIES <DI> LOSES PATENT APPEAL

Dresser Industries Inc said the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against it in its appeal of a 1985 judgment in favor of Hughes Tool Co <HT> concerning a patent infringement.     The case alleged that Dresser infringed on a Hughes patent regarding a drill bit sealing device, the company said.     However, Dresser said the Appellate Court set aside the royalty rate of 25 pct on selected bits as being arbitarary and returned the case to the district court level to ascertain a new rate.
