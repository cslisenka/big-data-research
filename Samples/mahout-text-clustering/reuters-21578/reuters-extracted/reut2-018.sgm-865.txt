FTC CHARGES KRAFT <KRA> WITH FALSE ADVERTISING

The Federal Trade Commission charged Kraft Inc with false and misleading advertising by overstating the calcuim content of its Kraft Singles cheese product.     In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged the Glenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with claiming that a slice of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Process Cheese Food (Kraft Singles) contains the same amount of calcium as five ounces of milk, when it does not.     The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singles contained more calcium than do most imitation cheese slices, the FTC charged.     The FTC complaint also charged that Kraft said it could substantiate these claims when, in fact, it could not.     "Nutritional information is important to consumers, but it can be difficult for them to verify." FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director William MacLeod said in a statement. "That is why we seek to maintain the accuracy of nutritional claims."     The FTC, which voted 4-1 in favor of issuing the complaint, generally takes such action when it has reason to believe that the law has been or is being violated and where it apears to the commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.     The filing of an administrative complaint marks the beginning of a proceeding that often takes up to a year in which the allegations will be ruled upon after a formal hearing.     If the commission's allegations are upheld, Kraft could be prohibited from misrepresenting the calcium or other nutrient content of its cheese-type products, including those made in comparative ads.     The company could also be prohibited from making such claims without having competent and reliable scientific evidence.  Reuter &#3;
