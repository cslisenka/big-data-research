CONSOB DELAYS MILAN BOURSE OPENING ONE HOUR

The opening of the Milan bourse and Italy's nine other stock exchanges has been delayed one hour to 1000 GMT by stock market regulatory agency Consob.     A Consob spokesman told Reuters the action was taken "to give operators time to reflect on the agreement between Treasury Secretary James Baker and West German officials on the Louvre accord." He did not elaborate.     The Milan Stock Index (MIB), base January 2 equals 1000, closed down 6.26 pct yesterday.  REUTER &#3;
