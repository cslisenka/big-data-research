EX-REAGAN AIDE DEAVER INDICTED ON PERJURY CHARGES

Former White House aide Michael Deaver, a long-time confidant of President Reagan, has been indicted on charges of lying about his contacts as a Washington lobbyist with top U.S. Government officials.     The five-count perjury indictment charged that Deaver lied in sworn testimony to Congress and before the grand jury investigating his business affairs.     Deaver, who resigned as deputy White House chief of staff in 1985 to open a lobbying firm, faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison if convicted. Immediately after the indictment was announced Reagan issued a statement wishing Deaver well.     The indictment charged that Deaver lied about his contacts with White House and cabinet officials on behalf of a wide range of clients, including foreign governments and large corporations.     Charges include that he lied about his contacts when hired by Canada to help settle a dispute over acid rain with the U.S. And when employed by Trans World Airlines to help thwart a takeover bid.     Deaver issued a statement denying he had committed perjury and predicting he would be acquitted at trial.  REUTER &#3;
