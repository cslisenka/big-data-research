HOMAC <HOMC> WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST TANGENT

Homac Inc said the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued a preliminary injunction against Tangent Inc of Dallas from appointing directors to Homac's board without written consent of a majority of shareholders.     It said the court also prohibited Tangent from acquiring or attempting to acquire any additional Homac shares pending filing of an amendment to Tangent's Schedule 13D.     Homac said the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction to prohibit transfer of approximately 800,000 shares of common stock by DSA Financial Corp to Tangent. Homac claims it had the first right to purchase.     Homac said it would appeal this aspect of the court's decision.  Reuter &#3;
