FED SAYS IT OFFERS TO BUY ALL COUPON ISSUES

The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market and offered to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds, a Fed spokesman said.     He said this coupon "pass," which adds permanent reserves to the banking system, was for regular delivery tomorrow.     Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-7/16 pct when the Fed announced the operation. Economists had been expecting the Fed to do this because of the need to offset seasonal factors expected to drain reserves heavily over the next few weeks. The Fed had previously offered to buy all coupon issues on March 31.  Reuter &#3;
