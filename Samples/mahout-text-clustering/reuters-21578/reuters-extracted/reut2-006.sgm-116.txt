WORKERS STRIKE AT SOUTHWEST FOREST <SWF> MILL

Southwest Forest Industries Inc said 344 members of the United Paperworkers International Union went out on strike at the company's Snowflake, Ariz., paper mill, temporarily halting operations at the newsprint and linerboard facility.     The mill, which employs 525 people, has an annual capacity of 282,000 tons of newsprint and 159,000 tons of linerboard, the company said.     Southwest Forest also said it is continuing to negotiate with the Internatinal Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose 65 members are honoring the paperworkers' picket lines.     The company said it intends to resume mill operations as quickly as possible using salaried employees, union workers who elect to work, contractors and newly hired replacements for the striking workers.
