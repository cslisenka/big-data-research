YEUTTER OPPOSES U.S. RETALIATORY POWER TRANSFER

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said President Reagan should have the authority and responsibility for deciding if and when to award import relief.     "As the only nationally-elected official in the government, only the president can weigh all the factors that go into determining whether or not it is in the national economic interest to do so," he said in a prepared address to the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.     Yeutter was commenting on proposed changes in the law which would transfer to the trade representative much of the current retaliatory power held by the White House, which has been the target of congressional dissatisfaction on trade issues.
