BANK BOARD CLOSES OREGON SAVINGS ASSOCIATION

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it had closed Future Savings and Loan Association of Albany, Ore., and transferred its insured deposits to Williamsburg Savings Bank of Salt Lake City, Utah.     Future had 6,614 accounts with total deposits of 57.3 mln dlrs. On Monday, its five branches in Oregon will open as branches of Williamsburg, which has 287 mln dlrs in assets and 19 offices in Oregon, Washington state and Utah.     The Bank Board said it closed Future because the association was insolvent.     The Board said Future lost money on commercial real estate loans which were poorly underwritten and inadequately appraised. Future also violated regulations on the amount of money which could be loaned to one individual, the Board said.     Accounts of up to 100,000 dlrs at Future are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC). Depositors with accounts of over 100,000 dlrs will share Future's assets on a pro rata basis after the assets have been liquidated.     Future was the ninth federal savings association to be closed this year compared with 21 in 1986.  Reuter &#3;
