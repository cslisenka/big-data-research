CANADA POPULATION GROWTH SLOWEST IN 25 YEARS

Canada's population increased 4.2 pct to 25.4 mln between 1981 and 1986, the lowest growth rate in any five year period for the past 25 years, according to final census figures released by Statistics Canada.     Lower immigration levels and a falling birth rate were behind the slower growth, the federal agency said. Canada's growth rate peaked at 9.7 pct in the 1961-1966 period.     Ontario, the most populous province with 9,113,515, led the provinces with a 5.7 pct increase. Newfoundland trailed with a 0.1 pct rise to 159,917 people.             Reuter &#3;
