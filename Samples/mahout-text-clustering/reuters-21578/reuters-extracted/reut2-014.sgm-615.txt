MOODY'S AFFIRMS UNITED TECHNOLOGIES <UTX> DEBT

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it affirmed the debt ratings of 3.7 billion dlrs of debt of United Technologies Corp and its units.     Affirmed were the Aa-3 senior debt of the parent and its units United Technologies Credit Corp, United Technologies Financial Services Inc, United Technologies Finance N.V., Carrier Corp and Carrier International Finance N.V. Also affirmed were the parent's Prime-1 commercial paper, Aa-3 Euroyen bonds and A-1 preferred stock.  United Technologies Credit Corp's A-1 subordinated debt was also affirmed, Moody's said.     Moody's cited its expectations that the company's programs will be successful in lowering operating costs and improving intermediate-term capital management. This will raise financial measures from current low levels.     As operating earnings and cash flow of the companies increase as a result of the programs, balance sheet leverage will decrease, the agency noted.     United Technologies and its units face strong competition but they all dominate their markets, Moody's pointed out.  Reuter &#3;
