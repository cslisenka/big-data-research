STOLTENBERG CONSIDERS RAISING SOME INDIRECT TAXES

Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was looking for ways to help finance a planned tax reform without increasing value-added tax but could not rule out raising some indirect taxes, for example, on tobacco.     Stoltenberg also told parliament that closing tax loopholes would contribute towards the 19 billion marks the government is seeking to finance part of its 44 billion mark tax reform package for the 1990s.     He confirmed that a temporary and limited increase in the borrowing requirement was also being considered.     Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said a temporary rise in borrowing was acceptable but stressed his government would exercise strict discipline in spending.     New net borrowing was 23.0 billion marks in 1986 compared with 37.2 billion in 1982.  REUTER &#3;
