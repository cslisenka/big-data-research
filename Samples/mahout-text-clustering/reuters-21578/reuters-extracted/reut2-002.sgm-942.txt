BIOMED RESEARCH LOSES TRANSFER AGENT

Biomed Research Inc said its transfer agent, First security Bank of Utah, will not continue to act as transfer agent for the company due to nonpayment of fees.     Since Biomed does not have sufficient funds to pay the transfer agent, the company urges against any purchases or sales until further notice.  Reuter &#3;
