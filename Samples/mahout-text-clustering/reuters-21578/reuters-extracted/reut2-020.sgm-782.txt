FIRST REPUBLICBANK <FRB> TROUBLED LOANS RISE

First RepublicBank Corp, the largest bank holding company in Texas, reported a loss of 6.3 mln dlrs for the third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rose sharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's real estate market.     There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of 1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through the merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.     Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end of September, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pct at the end of the second quarter.     Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct of the 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the third quarter, First Republicbank said.     It said the poor shape of the office and retail housing markets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to hold back earnings.     "As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, the company will continue to assess future common stock dividend payments relative to earnings performance," Gerald Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in a statement.     First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan loss provision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrs left its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billion dlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.     The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assets at the end of September.     The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cut in overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size of the combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct so far this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of the schedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.
