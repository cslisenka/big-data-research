NORANDA COPPER MINE SHUT DOWN AFTER FIRE

Noranda Inc said production at its Murdochville, Quebec copper mine was shut down by the fire that broke out last night, trapping 44 miners and killing one.     Noranda spokesman Denis Morin said it was impossible to judge how long the shutdown might last but said he thought it could be at least one week.     The mine produced 1,792,000 tonnes of ore in 1986, Morin said. It has a mineral inventory of 35,065,000 tonnes.     In the mine's three zones last year, copper grade was 1.10 pct at Needle Mountain, 0.30 pct at Copper Mountain Oxide and 1.32 pct at Murdochville, Morin said.     Another Noranda spokesman said the smelter at Murdochville, which has not been shut down, has the capacity to treat 218,000 tonnes of mineral concentrate per year.     The smelter treats ore from other mines as well as product from the Murdochville facility, he said.     The fire broke out last night in the mine which is situated in the Gaspe district of eastern Quebec.  Reuter &#3;
