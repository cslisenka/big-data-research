MCDOWELL <ME> TO GET QUALIFIED AUDIT

McDowell Enterprises Inc said its auditors have decided to qualify their opinion on 1986 financial statements due to questions about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.     McDowell said it will file its annual report for 1986 by April 15, after applying for an extension, and will report a loss for the year of about six mln dlrs after a substantial writedown of assets and an increase in costs associated with its withdrawal from the construction business.     In 1985, McDowell lost 2,152,000 dlrs before a 1,240,000 dlr loss from discontinued operations.  Reuter &#3;
