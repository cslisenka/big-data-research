EC DAIRY PACT MAY DISRUPT MARKET - DUTCH FARMERS

The new European Community dairy regime agreed last night is too complicated and may destabilise prices, Abele Kuypers, secretary of the dairy section of the Dutch farmers' organisation Landbouwschap said.     He welcomed the decision to write off existing stocks of butter and skimmed milk powder and agreed there should be some reduction of pressure on stores but said the Landbouwschap was unhappy at the mechanism for limiting sales to intervention except when prices fall too far.     But Harm Schelhaas, chairman of the Milk Commodity Board, was less worried by the new dairy regime. Dutch milk output will fall by up to six pct this year due to the new regime, but cheese output should rise, he said.  Reuter &#3;
