MOODY'S DOWNGRADES REPUBLICBANK <RPT>

Moody's Investors Service said it lowered the ratings on 464 mln dlrs of long-term debt issued by RepublicBank Corp and its two principal subsidiaries but upgraded 451 mln dlrs of securities of Interfirst Corp <IFC>.     The rating adjustments are based on the likelihood that the proposed merger of the two Texas banks will be consummated. Moody's said Interfirst is considerably the weaker of the two institutions.     Among the rating changes, RepublicBank's senior debt was downgraded to BA-1 from BAA-1 while Interfirst's was raised to BA-1 from B-1.  Reuter &#3;
