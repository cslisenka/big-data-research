BRAZILIAN UNION PROPOSES GENERAL STRIKE

The national executive of Brazil's most militant trade union group has proposed a general strike for July 15 in protest at the government's austerity program.     A spokeswoman for the Workers' Confederation (CUT) told Reuters the proposal would be discussed within the trade union movement. On Friday the government of President Jose Sarney introduced austerity measures to try to combat the country's high inflation rate, currently running at more than 1,000 pct a year.     It scrapped a trigger mechanism which had guaranteed regular pay rises in line with high inflation.     Trade unions say real wages are dropping by about a third.  Reuter &#3;
