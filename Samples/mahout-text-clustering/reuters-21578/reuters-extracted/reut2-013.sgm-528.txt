IRAN REPORTS IMPORTANT VICTORIES ON SOUTHERN FRONT

Iran said it had achieved important victories against Iraq on the southern war fronts last night.     A brief Iranian news agency IRNA report said "Important victories achieved in southern fronts Monday night." It gave no further details.     Iran launched a major offensive, codenamed Karbala-5, towards the major southern Iraqi port of Basra in January, but there have been no reports of heavy fighting in the area in recent weeks.
