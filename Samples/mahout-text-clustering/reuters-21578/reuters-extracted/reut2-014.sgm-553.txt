WESTMIN TO RAISE MYRA FALLS CAPACITY BY 33 PCT

<Westmin Resources Ltd> said it plans to increase capacity at its Myra Falls, British Columbia, base and precious metal mine and mill complex by 33 pct to 4,400 tons of ore a day, subject to regulatory approvals.     The company said the expansion will cost about 24 mln dlrs and could be in operation by 1988.     Economies of scale from the expansion should pay back net expansion cost in less than one year, Westmin said.     The Myra Falls complex processed 3,257 tons of ore a day during 1986.  Reuter &#3;
