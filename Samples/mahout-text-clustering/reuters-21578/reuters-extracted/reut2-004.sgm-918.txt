AMSTERDAM BOURSE SAID DELAYING DREXEL MEMBERSHIP

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange today declined to comment on a press report saying Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's request for membership had been delayed pending investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     The Exchange was replying to Reuters inquiries after the leading Dutch evening daily NRC Handelsblad published a report this evening quoting an unnamed bourse official as saying Drexel's application was delayed while the firm was under investigation by the SEC.     It usually takes the bourse one to two months to process a membership application, the official said, adding: "It's been going on for three to four months with Drexel, so draw your own conclusions."    "We're not particularly worried about the contents of the application but we think the timing is somewhat unfortunate," the NRC quoted the official as saying.    Drexel is currently under investigation by the SEC in connection with insider trading activities by Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine last November, a month after the company applied for permission to deal in Dutch equity.    An exchange spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the processing period of Drexel's application, adding that he would not comment on any company before all documents had been studied by the bourse board.    A spokesman from Drexel's London branch, which is dealing with the application, said the delay was of a purely technical nature in Drexel's head office in New York.  Reuter &#3;
