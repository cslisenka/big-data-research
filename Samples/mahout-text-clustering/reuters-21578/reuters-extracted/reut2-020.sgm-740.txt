GULF PEACE PLAN SAID TO CALL FOR CEASEFIRE, PROBE

Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes of the Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire, diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.     His nine-point plan, a refinement of proposals he took to Tehran and Baghdad last month, was delivered to the two sides last week with a request that they let him have their initial views before October 30.     The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer of an undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry into responsibility for the war was begun.     Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire, Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York on September 16.     As in his original proposals, the revised plan termed D-day a specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of a ceasefire, diplomats said.     On a specific date after that, which would have to be agreed, the withdrawal of all forces to internationally recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an agreed time frame, according to the account of his proposals.
