REUTERS SEEKS SHARE LISTING IN TOKYO

Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> said it plans to seek a listing for its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange later this year, subject to shareholder approval.     The Tokyo listing will create a 24-hour market for the stock. A company spokesman said the listing is expected in the final quarter. Sponsorship for the listing will be disclosed after shareholder approval is sought on April 29.     Reuters "B" ordinary shares are currently listed on the London Stock Exchange, while Reuters American Depositary Shares, representing six "B" shares, are quoted on NASDAQ in New York.     The company said a Tokyo listing would also increase its profile in Far Eastern markets. (Reuters has maintained a news bureau in Japan since the 1870s, and now employs about 180 people at its offices in Tokyo and Osaka).     Last month, Reuters announced plans jointly with Jiji Press, the Japanese financial news agency, to display Jiji services through the Reuter monitor and through the Reuter Composite Information System, CIS.     The Reuter Monitor Dealing Service was launched in Japan in 1986.  REUTER &#3;
