BANGLADESH SHIPPING EMPLOYEES CALL OFF STRIKE

Nearly 1,000 employees of Bangladesh Shipping Corp called off their two-week-old strike on Saturday after the authorities agreed to consider their demands for higher wages and benefits, corporation officials said.     The employees walked out on June 11 over their demands, forcing the government-run corporation to engage navy personnel to unload grain at the country's biggest Chittagong port.     Anwarul Haq, director of the corporation, said the strikers joined their work this morning after the authorities assured them they would review their demands soon.  Reuter &#3;
