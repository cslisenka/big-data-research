ARIZONA NUCLEAR PLANT RESTARTED AFTER SHUTDOWN

The Palo Verde Unit 1 nuclear power plant returned to service today following an automatic shutdown early Saturday morning, the Arizona Nuclear Power Project said.     The shutdown came during a weekly test of feedwater pumps leading to the steam generators on the non-nuclear side of the plant, a Power Project spokesman said. A defective electrical relay caused a feedwater pump to stop operating, leading to an automatic shutdown of the plant, he said.     Palo Verde Unit 1 was restarted Sunday following repairs and surveillance testing. Unit 1 was operating at 40 pct power Monday and is expected to return to full power, about 1300 megawatts, Tuesday, the spokesman said.     Palo Verde Unit 2 continues to operate at full power, generating 1347 gross megawatts, he said.     The Arizona Nuclear Power Project is a consortium including AZP Group's <AZP> Arizona Public Service, El Paso Electric <ELPA>, Public Service of New Mexico <PNM> and Southern California Edison <SCE>.
