DUTCH IBM UNIT CHARGED WITH PRICE UNDERCUTTING

Three Dutch computer leasing firms are charging the Dutch unit of International Business Machines Corp <IBM.N> with unfair trading practices, saying its prices undercut the leasing market, a court spokesman said.     He said the three firms started summary proceedings in the Amsterdam district court yesterday against IBM Nederland NV and its leasing finance subsidiary IBM Nederland Financieringen BV. A verdict is expected on April 16.     The three firms suing IBM here are IBL Holland BV, ICA Europe BV and Econocom Nederland BV. An IBM Nederland spokesman said the firm denied the charges but declined further comment.  REUTER &#3;
