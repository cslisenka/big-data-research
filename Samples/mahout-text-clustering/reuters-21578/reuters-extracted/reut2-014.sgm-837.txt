NEC SUES SEIKO EPSON OVER COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

NEC Corp <NESI.T> filed suit in Tokyo District Court to temporarily halt the manufacture and marketing of <Seiko Epson Corp>'s NEC-compatible personal computer series, an NEC spokesman said.     He said Seiko Epson's PC 286 computer and HDD-20 interface board infringe on software copyrights of the Basic In Out System program of NEC's best-selling 9801 computer series.     A spokesman for Seiko Epson, which is part of the Hattori Seiko Co Ltd <HATT.T> group, said its computer does not infringe on any copyrights and will be marketed this month.     The HDD-20 interface board went on sale last December.     NEC's request for an injunction against Seiko Epson and its marketing subsidiary is the first entirely domestic lawsuit charging infringement of computer software copyrights, the Seiko Epson spokesman said.     Share market analysts said that NEC controls about 70 pct of Japan's personal computer market.     Introduction of NEC-compatible machines could spark a price war and cut NEC's profits, as happened to International Business Machines Corp <IBM> following the introduction of IBM-compatible machines, they added.
