DELTA ROCKET BLASTS OFF FROM CAPE CANAVERAL

An unmanned Delta rocket carrying a 57 mln dlr hurricane-tracking satellite blasted off here today in NASA's first successful launch of the year.     The 116-foot (35.4-meter) Delta -- a reliable workhorse of the U.S. rocket fleet -- lifted off at 1805 EST from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in a crucial test of the space agency's ability to recover from the Challenger disaster and a string of other failures.     The launch came after two delays in two days. The first postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by high-speed crosswinds that NASA officials say could have torn the rocket apart during fiery ascent.  Reuter &#3;
