Allegheny International Inc said it plans to close three appliance manufacturing plants as part of a restructuring.     The company said it will close its Milwaukee plant by October 1, idling 350 employees, and its Dayton, Tenn., facility, with about 300 employees, by March 1, 1988.     In addition, a plant in Toronto will phase out production of small electric appliances over the next eight month's, affecting about 195 of the facility's 425 employees.     Production of barbecue grills and lawn mowers is also under review at the Toronto plant, operated by the company's Sunbeam Corp (Canada) unit. The plant will continue selling appliances in Canada.     The company's Oster division makes blenders and other appliances at the Milwaukee and Dayton plants. Oster headquarters will stay in Milwaukee and manufacturing of products will be consolidated at other facilities in McMinnville and Cookville, both in Tennessee.  Reuter &#3;
