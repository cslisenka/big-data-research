S/P DOWNGRADES DEL E. WEBB SUBORDINATED DEBT

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded to CCC-plus from single-B Del E. Webb Corp's <DWP> 30 mln dlrs of outstanding subordinated debt.     It said the issue was removed from Creditwatch, where it was placed on July 27 due to the deteriorating operating performance at Webb's minority owned and managed Atlantic City and Nevada casino/hotel businesses.     S and P said the downgrade reflects the casinos' dismal earnings and cash flow prospects and Webb's resultant weakened financial condition.  Reuter &#3;
