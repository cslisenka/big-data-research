JOHNSON SAYS GROWTH WILL DIFFUSE DEBT CRISIS

Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said a resolution of the debt crisis depends on growth in the industrialized world.     "We can work our way through as long as we have growth in industrialized countries to allow indebted countries to get out of their problems," Johnson told the Women in Housing and Finance.     Johnson also underscored the need to continue enforcing loan conditionality and repeated his opposition to debt relief. He rejected a "quick fix solution" adding, "There are no free lunches."
