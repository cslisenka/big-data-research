IONICS <ION> WINS 20-YEAR DESALINATION CONTRACT

Ionics Inc said it received a 20-year seawater desalination contract valued at more than 50 mln dlrs over the life of the contract from (Electrica Maspalomas SA), a water utility in Grand Canary Island, Spain.     The contract supplements a previously announced 15-year contract to supply desalted brackish water in the same geographical area. That contract is currently valued at 60 mln dlrs.     The stated value of the new contract excludes escalation and possible future increases in capacity, Ionics said. It calls for the supply of 1.7 mln gallons a day of drinking water on Grand Canary Island in Spain.  Reuter &#3;
