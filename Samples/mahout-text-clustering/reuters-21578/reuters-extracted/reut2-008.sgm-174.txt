SMALL DANISH BANK STOPS PAYMENTS - INSPECTORATE

A small Danish private bank, the 6.Juli Banken A/S, stopped payments today following a need for considerably higher provisions against loan losses, the Government Bank Inspectorate said in a statement.     Officials at the 6. Juli Bank were not immediately available for comment and calls to the Copenhagen head office were intercepted by an operator who said the office was closed.     The Inspectorate statement said: "Payments have been stopped out of regard for the depositors." This would allow closer investigation with a view to reconstruction and "negotiations on this have started."     The statement said: "The inspectors have inquired into certain financial transactions involving considerable extraordinary income in the submission of the 1986 balance sheet. The inspectors have not found themselves able to approve this book entry.     "The inspectors have further examined the bank's liquidity position and its commitments and have established the need for considerably higher provisions against losses on loans."     The bank is independent and has four branches in the Copenhagen area. Details of previous profits were not immediately available.     A spokesman for the Danish Banks Association said that the 6.July Bank was one of the smallest of Denmark's 80 banks, with balance sheet total of 861 mln crowns at end 1985, the latest year for which figures were available.     Denmark's banking legislation stipulates that equity capital and savings must be at least eight pct of debt and guarantee commitments, higher than for many countries.      REUTER &#3;
