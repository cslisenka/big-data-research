FAA ORDERS VOICE RECORDERS ON NEW COMMUTER CRAFT

The Federal Aviation Administration said it will require cockpit voice recorders to be installed on all newly made commuter aircraft by May 26 1989.     The FAA said data from the cockpit voice recorder, which makes a record of cockpit conversation during flight, was invaluable to accident investigators.     The new rule covers newly made jet and turbo prop commuter aircraft that carry six or more passengers and that must be flown by two pilots.  Reuter &#3;
