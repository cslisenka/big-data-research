DELMED <DMD> SELLS RIGHTS, PAYS CREDITORS

Delmed Inc said it sold sales and distribution rights of its peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical Care Inc and entered a five-year agreement to supply National Medical with dialysis solutions.     Terms were not disclosed. Half of the proceeds from the sale went to its principal bank group and unsecured creditors who had extended payment schedules, Delmed said.     The remaining proceeds will be used for production expansion at its Ogden, Utah plant, it said.     Delmed said future payments from supply agreement were pledged to its bank group as additional security. If Delmed is not in default at the time of payment, the banks will release the payment for Delmed to use for corporate purposes, it said.     It also said that as soon as it is able to do so, Delmed plans to pay all interest due on its convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 on which interest has not been paid since May 15, 1985.
