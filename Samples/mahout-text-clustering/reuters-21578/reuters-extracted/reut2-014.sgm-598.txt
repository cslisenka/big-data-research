U.S. DEBT FUTURES CLOSE DOWN, NEAR DAILY LOWS

U.S. debt futures closed down and near daily lows after a choppy session.     Continued weakness in the dollar pressured the market. Bearish sentiment prevailed despite remarks made by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker that a further large drop in the dollar could be counterproductive to the world economy.     New agreements by the G-5 and G-7 nations, which are meeting this week, on stabilizing currency rates are expected to have little effect on the market, traders said.     June T-bonds again failed to take out resistance at 98-16/32 as well as fill a chart gap between 98-25/32 and 99-16/32.     CBT T-bonds closed 28/32 to 30/32 point lower, T-notes fell 20/32 and muni bonds ended down one point. IMM T-bills ranged from 7 basis points lower to 2 basis points higher and Eurodollars closed down 6 to 11 basis points.  Reuter &#3;
