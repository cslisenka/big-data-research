SOVIET UNION, ISRAEL TO EXCHANGE DELEGATION VISITS

Israel's Ambassador to Washington said Israel and the Soviet Union have agreed to exchange visits by delegations in a move each hoped would lead to a renewal of ties after a 20-year break.     Ambassador Meir Rosenne told Israel Radio: "A Soviet delegation will come to Israel and an Israeli delegation to the Soviet Union, there is no doubt about that."     Rosenne said both countries had an interest in restoring ties severed by Moscow during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.  REUTER &#3;
