WATCHDOG GROUP SEEKS U.S. RECALL OF SCHOOLBUSES

The Center for Auto Safety, a private auto industry watchdog group, sought a government recall of 50,000 schoolbuses, charging that a defect in their manufacture causes the buses to split open in a crash.     The center said it asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to recall all school buses built since 1977 by Thomas Built Buses of High Point, N.C..     "In the past seven years, 45 children were injured and six killed in crashes of Thomas schoolbuses where the panels of the buses split open at the joints," Executive Director Clarence Ditlow wrote Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.     NHTSA is a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.     Ditlow said Thomas had failed eight body and three floor joint tests since 1977. "No Thomas schoolbus tested for joint strength since (a federal standard) was adopted in 1978 has ever passed," he said.     Officials of Thomas were unavailable for comment.     NHTSA officials had no immediate comment on the recall petition.  Reuter &#3;
