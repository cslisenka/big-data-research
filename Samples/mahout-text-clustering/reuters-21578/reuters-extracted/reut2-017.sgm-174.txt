ATCOR INC <ATCO.O> TO CONTEST ANTITRUST RULING

Atcor Inc said a Federal Court has reinstated a 1986 jury verdict against it and in favor of Indian Head Inc for antitrust damages of 3.8 mln dlrs before trebling and attorneys' fees.     The company said it will challenge the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which reversed a decision of the District Court in its favor.     The case involved charges that Atcor acted improperly in opposing Indian Head's attempt to have its plastic electrical conduit sanctioned by the National Fire Protection Association under the 1981 National Electrical Code, it said.     Atcor said the ruling by the three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal was incorrect and "seriously questionable in light of established Supreme Court doctrine".     The legal avenues to be examined in an attempt to have the ruling reversed could include filing a petition for Supreme Court review, the company added.  Reuter &#3;
