SUZUKI RECALLS 63,000 CARS

Suzuki Motor Co Ltd <SZMT> said it is recalling about 63,000 of its compact 1,300-cc SA-413 cars.     The cars, produced between May 1984 and January 1987, need modifications because insufficient space between the fuel tube and the cooling fan switching coupler could cause them to catch fire under ordinary driving conditions, the spokesman said.     Some 53,100 of the cars affected were sold abroad.  REUTER &#3;
