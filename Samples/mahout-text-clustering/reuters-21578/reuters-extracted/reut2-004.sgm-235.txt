FRANCE PLANS TIGHTER SHAREHOLDING DISCLOSURE LEVELS

The French government plans new legislation this year which will lower the thresholds at which investors in companies must declare their shareholdings, Bourse officials said.     The new rules, part of a scheme to provide more openness in corporate ownership structure, will lower the initial declaration threshold to five pct of a company's capital.     Under current rules, an investor has to notify the Bourse supervisory commission when a holding exceeds 10 pct, and again at 33 pct and 50 pct. The officials said a 20 pct level has also been added to the scale.  Reuter &#3;
