WARNER-LAMBERT <WLA> WINS PACKAGING SUIT

Warner-Lambert Co said a federal court judgment resulted in <My-K Laboratories Inc> agreeing to discontinue the sale of cough syrup and a children's allergy elixir because it imitates Warner-Lambert  packaging.     Warner-Lambert said the final consent judgment was entered in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois. It also said the packaging in question imitated its own packaging of Benylin and Benadryl products.     My-K agreed to adopt different packaging, Warner-Lambert said.  Reuter &#3;
