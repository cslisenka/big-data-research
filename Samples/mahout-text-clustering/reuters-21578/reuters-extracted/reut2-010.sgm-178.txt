COSTA RICAN CENTRAL BANK CHIEF RESIGNS

Eduardo Lizano, President of Costa Rica's central bank and the country's chief debt negotiator, has tendered his resignation and will be leaving the government next month, a central bank spokesman said.     Spokesman Manuel Melendez said Lizano announced his decision to leave the bank late yesterday during a meeting of its board of directors.     "Lizano has always been an educator and he intends to dedicate himself to teaching at the university of Costa Rica," Melendez said.  Reuter &#3;
