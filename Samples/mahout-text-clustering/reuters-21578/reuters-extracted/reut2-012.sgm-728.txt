SOVIET UNION STAGES THIRD NUCLEAR TEST

The Soviet Union conducted an underground nuclear test aimed at perfecting military technology, the official news agency Tass reported.     Tass said the test was carried out at 0120 gmt at the Semipalatinsk testing ground in Kazakhstan, Soviet Central Asia.     It was the third Soviet underground blast since Moscow halted an 18-month nuclear test moratorium last February, saying Washington's refusal to join the ban had forced it to resume testing.
