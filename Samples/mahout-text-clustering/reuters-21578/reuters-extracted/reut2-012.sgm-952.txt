PRESIDIO OIL <PRS> BEGINS EXCHANGE OFFER

Presidio Oil Co said it began an offer to exchange shares of its recently created class A common stock for shares of its class B common stock on a share-for-share basis.     The oil and gas company also said it plans to declare an annual cash dividend of 10 cts a share, payable quarterly, on the class A stock. Though not restricted from doing so, it does not plan to pay cash dividends on the class B common.     The exchange offer is on a one-time only basis and will be open for 90 days, it said.
