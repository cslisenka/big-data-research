USDA FOREIGN POSTS THREATENED BY TIGHT BUDGET

The U.S. Agriculture Department will be forced to close 13 foreign posts and reduce personnel in five others unless Congress approves two mln dlrs in supplemental appropriations for fiscal 1987 to cover increased overseas costs due to changes in the value of currencies, a senior department official said.     Thomas Kay, administrator of USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee that the devaluation of the U.S. dollar since 1985 has raised USDA's costs in many of its 75 offices overseas.     Kay declined to say which posts were jeopardized by rising foreign costs.     In Europe and Japan, the dollar's decline is expected to raise the costs of running offices staffed by agricultural attaches and trade officers by 2.5 mln dlrs in the current fiscal year compared with 1985 estimates, according to FAS projections.     Favorable exchange rate changes are expected to cut FAS spending by about 510,000 dlrs elsewhere, FAS said.     The House Appropriations Committee has approved one mln dlrs in supplemental funds to cover FAS losses. The full House may take up the measure, folded into a government-wide supplemental appropriations bill, next week.     Staff on the House panel said the committee balked at appropriating two mln dlrs because the White House budget office turned down FAS's request for the supplemental.  Reuter &#3;
