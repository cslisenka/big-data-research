BETHLEHEM STEEL <BS> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it downgraded Bethlehem Steel Corp's debt securities.     Bethlehem has one billion dlrs of debt and preferred stock outstanding. Cut were its senior debt to CCC-plus from B-minus and subordinated debt to CCC-minus from CCC. S and P affirmed the C-rated preferred, since preferred dividends were discontinued last year.      S and P cited concerns over Bethlehem's viability over the intermediate term, rather than any immediate threat to solvency. Its cash is strong relative to 1987 requirements, but was accumulated through such means as asset sales.  Reuter &#3;
