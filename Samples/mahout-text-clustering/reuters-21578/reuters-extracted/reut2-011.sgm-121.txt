ANGLO CHIEF URGES S.AFRICA REPEAL DISCRIMINATION

Anglo American Gold Investment Co chairman Julian Thompson urged the South African government to repeal legislation preventing black advancement in the mining industry.     Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the mining industry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intends to remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilled jobs.     He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing a bill when parliament reconvenes later this year.     The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners are black but whites perform most supervisory jobs.     The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to all races this year but the mining industry fears clauses inserted in an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult for blacks to qualify for skilled positions.     "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatory provisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies them opportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompson said.
