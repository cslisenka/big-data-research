BELGIAN GOVERNMENT REACHES BUDGETARY ACCORD

Senior Belgian cabinet ministers reached an agreement on budgetary economies, which will allow the net budgetary financing requirement to remain within previously set limits, the government said in a statement.     The statement, issued as ministers ended a marathon meeting in the early hours of this morning, did not give further details.     However, Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt said before the meeting he was seeking economies of at least 21.2 billion francs in order to keep the financing requirement at 418 billion francs this year, or eight pct of Gross National Product.     The government set this figure as its target for the financing requirement last year when it announced a program of cuts designed to reduce spending by 195 billion francs in 1987.     However, Verhofstadt had claimed that subsequent developments had meant that unless further cuts were found, the financing requirement would be considerably higher.     Last year, Belgium had a financing requirement of 561 billion francs, or 11.0 pct of GNP.     A government spokeswoman said the accord would be considered by the full cabinet later today, and Prime Minister Wilfried Martens would announce it to Parliament on Monday.     She said no details would be made public before then.  REUTER &#3;
