MIDSESSION FEEDER CATTLE FUTURES MIXED

Feeder Cattle futures traded 0.02 cent lower to 0.25 higher in light midsession dealings.     All but distant March posted a new season's high on general demand before profit-taking developed. Spreading of long deferred cattle futures/short May feeder cattle added to the pressure in May, traders said.     Although profit-taking weighed on prices, strong fundamentals continued to provide support. Cash feeder cattle remain strong on limited supplies and continued gains in live cattle futures prompted spillover demand.     The average feeder steer price, USFSP, rose 10 cents in the past two reporting days, traders noted.  Reuter &#3;
