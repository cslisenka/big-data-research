U.S. TAX FRAUD CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST THREE

Three men were charged today with operating a large tax fraud scheme that provided more than 500 mln dlrs in phony tax losses for many prominent people, including CBS Inc. <CBS> president Laurence Tisch and his brother Preston, who is President Reagan's postmaster general.     The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury to in New York.     The three indicted were named as Charles Atkins, William Hack and Ernest Grunebaum, all well-known promoters of tax shelters. Atkins was well-known as an organizer of tax shelters in the late 1970s and early 1980.     The indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, the defendants conspired to defraud the government by arranging "rigged and fraudulent" transactions in governmenmt securities and false tax deductions based on phony trading losses and interest expenses.     More than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed on to partners in three tax shelters.     In addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phony trading losses and interest expenses to other entities and individuals to be used as tax deductions.     The indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in trading losses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme but were off-set by "fictious gains."     Laurence Tisch was said by the indictment to have reported a net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. His brother, Preston Tisch, reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.     None of the three men's clients were charged with any criminal acts. But should the three be found guilty, their clients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoided through the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possibly penalties.   Reuter &#3;
