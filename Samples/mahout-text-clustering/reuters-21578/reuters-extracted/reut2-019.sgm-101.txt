U.S. BUDGET CHIEF THREATENS VETO, PREDICTS DEAL

U.S. Budget Director James Miller said President Reagan would veto the Democrat-controlled Congress' new budget plan out of hand -- but offered to compromise on raising revenues.     "If that budget comes down it will vetoed out of hand, I can tell you that," Miller said on a morning television show.     He said Reagan would not accept the 19 bln dlr tax increase in Congress' proposal but said "keep in mind the president has proposed certain revenues in his budget.     "They're not taxes," Miller said. "They are user charges and asset sales. I think there is some room there we can sit down and talk with the Democrats about."     Miller said he believed a compromise could be worked out but he said the administration would need assurance that whatever compromise it accepted would indeed by passed by Congress.     Miller also said in the interview that he did not believe the new U.S. protection of 11 Kuwaiti tanker ships in the Persian Gulf would require a supplemental request to Congress later for more defense money.
