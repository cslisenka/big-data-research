JAPAN BANKS FACE BIG LOSSES ON PERPETUAL FLOATERS

Japanese banks may have to realize significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market, bankers said.     How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal year ending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommended by the Finance Ministry. Ministry sources said the Ministry has yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing the perpetual floating rate notes they hold.     The notes are held by Japanese city, trust, long-term and regional banks, including their overseas branches.     Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the current market price, whichever is lower, bankers said.     With the market for such perpetuals non-existent, Finance Ministry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal quotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine bank book losses.     The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using such quotations, one official said.     Banks using current market prices alone to value their holdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue that the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next year, bankers said.     But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign portfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said. The acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price, whatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in the current fiscal year.  REUTER &#3;
