WALL STREET STOCKS/AUTOMAKERS

Shares of Detroit automakers rose sharply in active trading as investors scrambled to accumulate the stocks in anticipation of postive announcements by Ford Motor Co <F> and General Motors Corp <GM> at meetings to be held at the end of the week, traders said.     General Motors gained two points to 83-1/2 and Ford one to 91-1/8. Chrysler Corp <C>, which is not expected to make any major announcements this week, rose 1/4 to 58-1/2.     "There is a little mystery coming at the end of the week for the automakers," one trader said, "and in a bull market, investors don't mind the mystery so much."     Yesterday, GM's stock climbed 1-3/4 points on expectations that the company might disclose some bullish news at a meeting before analysts on April 9-10. A GM spokesman had no comment on the meeting.     GM chairman Roger Smith is expected to attend the meeting, along with GM president James McDonald and other senior GM executives.      "The stock could be moving up just on the proximity of the meeting, thinking GM will say something positive," analyst Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs said.     Though he maintains a buy recommendation on GM, Fricke said he cut 1987 earnings estimates for the company by 50 cts a share to 7.30 dlrs a share because of the costs of incentive programs. The company earned 8.21 dlrs a share in 1986.      Monday, Ford closed 2-5/8 points higher as rumors circulated that the company would announce a higher dividend and a three-for-two stock split at it Thursday board meeting.      A Ford spokesman said, "it is likely they will have a dividend announcement." He said it is a board policy to make a dividend announcement at the first board meeting of the quarter, but he would not comment on any plans for a change in the dividend or a stock split.
