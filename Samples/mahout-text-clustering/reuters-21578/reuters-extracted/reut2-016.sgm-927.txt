ARGENTINE TROOPS END UPRISING

Rebellious troops in the central city of Cordoba called off an uprising against President Raul Alfonsin's government, the army command said.     Congressional leaders said that it would probably not be necessary therefore to declare a state of siege.      Military officers earlier said army units in Buenos Aires and Misiones provinces had supported the Cordoba regiment, the focal point of the uprising. The troops were objecting to human rights trials.  Reuter &#3;
