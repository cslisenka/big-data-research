S. AFRICA MINES BODY SEES MAY DAY WORK STOPPAGE

Negotiations between mining companies and the National Union of Mineworkers are foundering and mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber of Mines said.     It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue, the introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.     The union refused a request to give advance notification of the names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather than taking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.     It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to plan their operations.     "The union is adamant only employees who wish to work on Labour Day should notify management," the Chamber said.     "This raises the prospect that the mines will once again face stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who do not work will once again forfeit pay."     It said the union accepted all the proposals except giving advance notification for May 1.     It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May 1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for working that day.  REUTER &#3;
