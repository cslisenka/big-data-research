AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY NEEDS MORE INVESTMENT, BANK

Australia faces the risk of recession if capital expenditure does not grow from the subdued levels of recent years, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said.     "Without stronger levels of capital expenditure, the structural adjustment that is so critical to overcoming the economy's fundamental problems cannot occur," the bank said its latest Economic Newsletter.     "In that event, Australia would be destined to experience a prolonged period of sub-par growth at best, with the very real risk that the onset of serious recession would become unavoidable," it said.     Australia's medium-term economic performance will be fundamentally determined by business investment in the period immediately ahead, the bank said.     It said spending has been disappointing in recent years due to low capacity utilisation, low expected profitability and very high real interest rates.     There also appears to be little likelihood of any significant improvement for the present, it said.     Investment is strongly influenced by medium-term uncertainties and risks and these are likely to continue for the present, it said.  REUTER &#3;
