HIGH COURT LETS STAND RULING FOR WESTERN UNION

The Supreme Court let stand a ruling that threw out a 36-mln-dlr judgment that Western Union Telegraph Co had been ordered to pay to a now-defunct independent teleprinter vendor.     The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling last July by a U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago that threw out the jury's 1985 verdict and judgment in a major antitrust case.     The case stemmed from a 1977 lawsuit filed by Olympia Equipment Leasing Co, Alfco Telecommunications Co and the companies' late founder, Abraham Feldman of San Francisco.  Reuter &#3;
