NASA ROCKET FAILS AFTER TAKEOFF

An Atlas Centaur rocket launching a military communications satellite went out of control a minute after launch and was destroyed, a NASA spokesman said.     The Atlas Centaur blasted off in rainy and overcast conditions. Within seconds controllers reported it was out of control and the order to blow it up was given.     NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said the rocket may have been struck by lightening.     The failure is the first for NASA since May 1986, when a Delta rocket failed.  Reuter &#3;
