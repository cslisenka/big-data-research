CORROON/BLACK <CBL> SAYS UNIT IN LLOYD'S FUND

Corroon and Black Corp said <Minet Holdings PLC>, of which it owns 25 pct, agreed to participate in a 103 mln stg fund set up by Lloyd's of London to cover part of the claims faced by PCW underwriting agencies.     The company said Minet and several other companies were involved in the syndicate, which faces 235 mln stg in claims due to fraud and mismanagement.     The fund was proposed by Lloyd's to cover a portion of the claims in return for a contribution of 34 mln stg from PCW members. The offer is subject to acceptance by 90 pct of the PCW members by May 30.     Lloyd's 103 mln stg offer, including 48 mln stg from Lloyd's and 55 mln stg from brokers, is designed to cover the reinsurance costs on the 235 mln stg of net liabilities.     Minet was unable to disclose the amount of its proposed contribution to the fund, Caroon and Black said. However, Minet was confident that the losses could be funded from existing cash resources.     Under the terms proposed, Lloyd's would take over all members' future obligations connected with PCW, and members would agree not to pursue the matter in court.  Reuter &#3;
