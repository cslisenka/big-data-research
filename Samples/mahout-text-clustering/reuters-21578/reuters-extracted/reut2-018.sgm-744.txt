FECSA TO MEET DEBT NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE TUESDAY

Officials of Fuerzas Electricas de Cataluna S.A. (FECSA), the Spanish electricity company, will hold the first meeting with members of a new debt negotiating committee representing its creditors in Barcelona on Tuesday, senior bankers said.     The talks will cover a possible rescheduling of the company's 610.57 billion peseta debt, which includes both foreign and domestic loans and other debt instruments.     The committee was formed earlier this month after FECSA agreed to rescind self-imposed terms for its debt repayments, which were unacceptable to the banks.     The negotiating committee is a subcommittee of a broader creditor steering committee made up of some 22 creditor banks and leasing companies, which is co-chaired by Bank of America International Ltd and The Sanwa Bank Ltd.     Bank of America and Sanwa also will co-chair the negotiating committee. The other members are Bankers Trust Co, Caixa de Barcelona, Confederacion Espanola de Cajas de Ahorros, Chase Manhattan Bank, Deutsche Bank, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, Orient Leasing Ltd, Crown Leasing Ltd and Japan Overseas Leasing Co. These banks also are on the broader steering committee.     Bankers said that in addition to the negotiating committee, there also will be a seven-member sub-committee for documentation and finance of which Citicorp will be chairman. Gulf Bank KSC will chair a separate committee within the committee for the documentation.     The final list of the creditors participating in the various committees was formulated this morning, and the steering committee is now notifying FECSA's approximately some 320 creditors of the results.
