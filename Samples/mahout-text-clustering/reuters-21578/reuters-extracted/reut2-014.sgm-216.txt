LONDON EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS CLOSE QUIETLY STEADY

Eurodollar deposit rates closed little changed around the levels established at midmorning. Rates at the longer end of the market showed 1/16 point gains on a weak opening from the dollar, dealers said.     Trading remained very quiet throughout the day with operators sidelined in the absence of major U.S. Economic data and ahead of this week's Group of Seven meeting in Washington. The G-7 finance ministers are due to discuss their February pact on currency stability and this could well have an impact.     One to five month eurodollars were steady with three months closing at 6-9/16 7/16 pct.     Dealers noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would hit investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending. Volcker was testifying to the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said a further fall in the dollar would be counterproductive and that the currency's performance could be a factor in determining U.S. Monetary policy.     Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to spot/next quoted at a uniform 6-1/4 1/8 pct. The Fed added temporary reserves via two-day system repurchase agreements with Fed funds trading at 6-1/8 pct.  REUTER &#3;
