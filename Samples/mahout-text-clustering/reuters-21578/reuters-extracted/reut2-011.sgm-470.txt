SUBCOMMITTE APPROVES SAVINGS INSURANCE FUND

A House Banking subcommittee voted to authorize a 25 billion dlr recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and allow forebearance of some bad loans by savings associations.     The Financial Institutions subcommittee approved the 25 billion dlr recapitalization plan proposed by Rep. Thomas Carper, D-Del, on a 23-20 vote in place of a five billion dlr plan offered by Committee chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I. The Senate last week approved a 7.5 billion dlr FSLIC refinancing.     The subcommittee also voted to make associations which leave FSLIC pay twice the regular annual premium and twice the special assessment as exit fees. The bill will go to the full committee for further action.  Reuter &#3;
