WHITE HOUSE SAYS MARCH CPI "NO CAUSE FOR ALARM"

The White House said last month's 0.4 per cent in increase in the CPI, the third sharp rise in three months and one that brought the annual inflation rate to 6.2 pct so far this year, was no cause for alarm.     "While this is something to watch, it's not something to be alarmed about," said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.     He said the three month increase in inflation was due almost entirely to higher energy prices.     Fitzwater said once an OPEC price hike is "passed through the system," the nation should see a slowing of the inflation rate to the administration's 3.8 pct 1987 forecast.  REUTER &#3;
