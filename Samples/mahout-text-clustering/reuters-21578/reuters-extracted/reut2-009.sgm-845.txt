COLONIAL <CABK> TALKS WITH DISSIDENTS BREAK DOWN

Colonial American Bankshares Corp said it met with the dissident shareholder group Colonial American Shareholders Committee to consider a settlement to their dispute that would give the group representation on the Colonial board, but the talks broke down.     The company said it does not want a proxy contest, but if the committee presents nominees for election as directors at the April 27 annual meeting, Colonial will take "all appropriate steps" to win.     The company said "There was disagreement on several issues, including a demand by the committee for reimbursement by the corporation of approximately 275,000 dlrs in exepnses incurred by the committee.  The board felt it was inappropriate to reimburse the committee for any of its expenses."     The group owns under 15 pct of Colonial stock.  Colonial has nominated a slate of four directors for election at the annual meeting.  Reuter &#3;
