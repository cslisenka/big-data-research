CALIFORNIA WORKERS END LONG CANNERY STRIKE

An 18-month strike against Watsonville Canning and Frozen Foods, one of California's largest food processors, ended with workers overwhelmingly ratifying a new contract.     More than 1,000 workers walked off their jobs in September 1985 after Watsonville Canning cut their wages from 6.66 dlrs an hour to 4.85 dlrs.     Watsonville declared bankruptcy last week and the cannery was taken over by Norcal Frozen Foods Inc., a consortium of growers. A spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 912 said the workers voted 543-21 in favor of a new contract.     The Norcal offer provides a 5.85 dlrs-per-hour wage with no additional benefits for most workers for up to three years.  Reuter &#3;
