American Adventure Inc said its reorganization plan was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of the State of Washington.     The company said the plan calls for the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company to a new company, which will retain the name American Adventure Inc, and be incorporated in Delaware.     The transaction is scheduled for later this month when shareholders of the old company will receive one share of stock in the new company for every 10 shares they hold in the old company, according to American Adventure.
