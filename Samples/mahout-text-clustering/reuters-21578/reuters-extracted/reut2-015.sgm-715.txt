WASTE RECOVERY <WRII> IN DEAL WITH BLUE CIRCLE

Waste Recovery Inc said it has received an exclusive license to use <Blue Circle Industries PLC's> refuse-derived fuel technology in the U.S.     The company said it plans to modify a 750 short ton per day resource recovery plant in Miami to use the technology and will sell refuse-derived fuel from the Miami plant to Lone Star Industries Inc's <LCE> Hialeah, Fla., cement plant, to take the place of about 20 pct of the Hialeah plant's coal usage.     Waste Recovery said initial demonstration trials are scheduled for the fourth quarter.     Waste Recovery said it also plans to build two new scrap tire processing plants to produce tire-derived fuel in Atlanta and in the Philadelphia area.  It said Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co <GT>, its main shareholder, has agreed to supply Waste Recovery with scrap tires for raw materials for fuel.     It said tire-derived fuel trials by major cement and paper companies in the Southeast are scheduled for the second and third quarters of 1987, with fuel for the trials to come from its Houston plant.
