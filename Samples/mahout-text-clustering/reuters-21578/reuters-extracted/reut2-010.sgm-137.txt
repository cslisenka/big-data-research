FARM CREDIT AID SEEN BROADENED TO OTHER LENDERS

Farm-state Senators indicated they may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as well as the farm credit system.     Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.     "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown, principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and ranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.     Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should cover all lenders to agriculture.     The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system. Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how to resurrect the failing system.     Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included in the aid package because "it would not be fair to address only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."     However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the broad approcah would cost.     But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of 3.5 billion dlrs annually.  Reuter &#3;
