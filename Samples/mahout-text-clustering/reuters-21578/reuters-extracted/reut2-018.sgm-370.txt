BLOCKED RHINE NAVIGATION CHANNEL REMAINS CLOSED

The main navigation channel of the Rhine, blocked by two sunken boats, will remain closed at least until the beginning of next week, a water authority spokesman said today.     Karlsruhe water authorities said a queue of about 70 ships had formed between the towns of Speyer and Iffezheim but most shipping companies had unloaded cargoes and were using alternative means of transport.     Heinz-Josef Recker, of the Mannheim water authority, said two floating cranes would make a fresh attempt to raise the sunken tug and its lighter after an unsuccessful try on Friday. The tug Orinoko hit a railway bridge last Tuesday and sank with a cargo of 3,500 tonnes of gravel on board. Before the accident, about 100 ships a day sailed under the bridge.  Reuter &#3;
