CANADA GOVERNMENT SPENDING TO RISE 3.8 PCT

The federal government's expenditures will rise 3.8 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 to 110.14 billion dlrs from 107.01 billion dlrs in fiscal 1987, the Treasury Board said.     The board noted the growth in the main estimates is the lowest since 1962, and below last year's 3.9 pct increase.     After inclusion of two special accounts, an unemployment insurance fund and a grain stabilization fund, total expenditures amount to 122.55 billion dlrs, the same as the estimate in the government's budget last month. The budget also estimated a deficit of 29.3 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988.  Reuter &#3;
