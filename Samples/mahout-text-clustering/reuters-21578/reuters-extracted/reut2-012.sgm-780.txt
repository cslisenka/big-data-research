GEC WINS ROBOTS ORDER FROM USSR

The General Electric Co Plc <GECL.L> said its Electrical Projects division had won an initial 2.5 mln stg order to supply robots to the Soviet motor industry.     Eighteen paint-spraying robots will be installed at the Gaz truck and car plant in Gorky, GEC said in a statement. If the factory standardised on the GEC product, further orders for up to 80 more robots could be expected, it added.     Division engineering director Alan Davies said he expects further agreements soon with the Soviet machine tool and chemical equipment industries. These would cover the part manufacture of 100 to 200 GEC robots per year in the USSR.  REUTER &#3;
