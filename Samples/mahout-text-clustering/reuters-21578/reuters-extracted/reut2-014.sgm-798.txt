U.S. INTEREST RATE FUTURES OPEN SLIGHTLY LOWER

U.S. Interest rate futures opened slightly lower on underlying weakness of the U.S. Dollar, dealers said.     Sentiment was also dampened by a firmer federal funds rate and stable oil prices. Remarks by Federal Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on the need for foreign exchange stability had little impact on the market, they said.     June eurodollar opened at 93.26 below Chicago's close of 93.29 and September at 93.18 below 93.21 with around 720 lots traded.     June T-bond futures opened at 97.02 below Chicago's close of 97.08 on early turnover of 15 lots.     REUTER &#3;
