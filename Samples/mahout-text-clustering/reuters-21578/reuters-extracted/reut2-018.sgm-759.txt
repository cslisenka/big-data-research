GULF CANADA <GOC.TO> HOLDERS APPROVE PLAN

Gulf Canada Corp shareholders at the annual meeting approved a previously reported reorganization plan giving shareholders stock in three publicly traded companies.     Shareholders will receive 66 shares in Gulf Canada Resources Ltd, 29 shares of Abitibi-Price Inc <AIB.TO> and 20 common shares of GW Utilities Ltd for every 100 shares in Gulf Canada Corp. GW Utilities, a new company, will hold Gulf's 83 pct stake in Consumers Gas Co Ltd, 49 pct of Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd and 41 pct of Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd <IPL.TO>.      Debenture holders who objected to the plan withdrew a proposed amendment when Gulf Canada chairman Marshall Cohen said they would receive compensation for six months of interest they would otherwise have lost under the plan.     The debenture holders had sought to postpone the reorganization's effective date to July 16 from July 1 in order to earn interest for the latest six-month period.  Reuter &#3;
