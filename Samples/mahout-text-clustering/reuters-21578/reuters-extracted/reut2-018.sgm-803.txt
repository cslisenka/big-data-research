1988 U.S. BUDGET CLEARED BY COMMITTEE

A joint House-Senate committee formally approved a 1988 budget plan certain to touch off a battle with President Reagan over taxes and defense.     The budget, a compromise of earlier House and Senate budgets, was negotiated yesterday by House and Senate Democratic leaders.     The plan, slated for House action next Tuesday, would reduce next year's estimated 171-billion-dlr deficit to about 134 billion dlrs.     It proposes 19 billion dlrs in new taxes next year and cuts Reagan's defense mark.  Reuter &#3;
