VW DISMISSES HEAD OF ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPT

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> said it has dismissed the head of its foreign exchange department and suspended several other staff members following the recent emergence of a possible currency fraud at the company.     A VW statement said foreign exchange department chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed with immediate effect.     It said it has also suspended Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer department, and Siegfried Mueller, head of the central cash and currency clearing department. Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also suspended.     VW said the possibly fraudulent foreign currency transactions, which could cost the company 480 mln marks, fell directly within the area of responsibility of Borchert and Mueller.     VW said Adalbert Sedlmair, formerly finance director at VW's former office equipment subsidiary Triumph-Adler AG, would temporarily take over responsibility of the financial transfer department during Borchert's suspension from duties.     Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Brunswick, which is looking into the currency transactions, said the Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden had also joined the investigation and would be responsible for measures such as possible police searches.     A spokeswoman for the office said prosecutors in Frankfurt were looking into the possibility of taking over the VW case but added a final decision would be taken next week.     The short VW statement said, "Burkhard Junger, 39, who had already been suspended from his duties in January, has been dismissed with immediate effect."     Company sources said Borchert and Mueller were not thought to have been directly involved with the currency transactions but they may have been lax in their supervision.  REUTER &#3;
