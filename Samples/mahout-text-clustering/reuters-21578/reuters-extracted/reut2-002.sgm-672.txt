PHILIP CROSBY <PCRO> PROBES POSSIBLE EMBEZZLING

Philip Crosby Associates Inc said it and police authorities are investigating a possible embezzlement by a bonded former employee that may involve several hundred thousand dollars.     The company said it does not expect the possible embezzlement to materially affect 1986 earnings. It said the release of results will be delayed for about a week by the investigation.     Crosby said the amount may be covered by a fidelity bond and it believes it stands a good chance of recovering much of the money.     The company said it intends to prosecute.  Reuter &#3;
