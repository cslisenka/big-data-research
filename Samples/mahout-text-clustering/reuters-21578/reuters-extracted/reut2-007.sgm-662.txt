POLISH UNIONS WARN AGAINST PRICE HIKES

Sharp price hikes for food and fuel planned by the government could provoke an open confrontation with workers and endanger Poland's fragile post-Solidarity stability, a government trade union leader has warned.     Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the national trade union alliance OPZZ, said the unions' strong rejection of the increases yesterday was prompted by the hostility of lower-paid workers.     The authorities told the OPZZ on Tuesday that food prices would rise by an average of 13 pct but ncreases for fuels -- including electricity and gas -- would be much higher.     They said wage increases would be limited to 12 pct in 1987 and that employers who breached the ceiling would be punished through additional taxes.  Reuter &#3;
