GAO STUDY SOUGHT ON FSLIC-FDIC MERGER

House Banking committee chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., said he would ask the General Accounting Office to make a study of the feasibility of merging the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.     St Germain made the comment during subcommittee action on a bill to authorize 25 billion dlrs in refinancing for the FSLIC, which says it needs more money to close financially troubled thrift institutions.     The General Accounting Office is the investigating agency of Congress.  Reuter &#3;
