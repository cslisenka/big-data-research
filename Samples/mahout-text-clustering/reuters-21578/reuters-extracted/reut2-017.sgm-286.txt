VENEZUELA FINANCE MINISTER TO JAPAN IN MID-MAY

Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said today he will travel to Japan in mid-May to seek new credits for planned expansions in Venezuela's state aluminum, steel and petrochemical industries.     Azpurua told reporters he will be accompanied by Central Bank President Hernan Anzola and Director of Public Finance Jorge Marcano.     'The idea is to hold meetings with Japanese economic and financial authorities, with the banks which have business and credits in Venezuela and with some of the Japanese companies already active here,' Azpurua said.
