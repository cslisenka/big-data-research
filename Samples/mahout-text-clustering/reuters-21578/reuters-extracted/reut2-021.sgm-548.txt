TDK SALES RISE ON ELECTRONIC PARTS SALES

TDK Corp <TDK.T> said its sales rose 3.6 pct in the three months ended August 31 due to better sales of electronic materials and components, which grew 9.2 pct compared with the same period of 1986.     Net profit gained only 0.5 pct due to lower interest income and exchange losses which depressed non-operating income, it said. It earlier reported net up to 4.20 billion from 4.18 billion in the year earlier period after sales up to 95.96 billion from 92.59 billion. The proportion of overseas sales to total sales fell to 45.2 pct from 45.6 pct a year earlier due to lower tape sales to North America.  REUTER &#3;
