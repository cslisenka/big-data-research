WORLD SUGAR FUTURES TUMBLE IN EARLY TRADING

World sugar futures tumbled early when sell stops were triggered at 6.60 and 6.55 cents basis the spot contract, traders said.     Spot May dropped 0.27 cent to 6.52 cents a lb. It opened at 6.72 cents.     Trade houses worked both sides of the market, analysts said.     The decline may have been a continued reaction to the market's inability yesterday to breach resistance around 6.93 cents basis May, which unsettled traders, analysts said.     The market should draw support from buying tenders slated for tomorrow and Saturday, they said.  Reuter &#3;
