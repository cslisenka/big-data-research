FOREIGN INVESTMENT RISES IN MALAYSIA

Foreign investment in Malaysia in 1986 rose to 524.5 mln ringgit, the highest since 1971, from 324.9 mln in 1985, the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority, MIDA, said.     MIDA director-general N. Sadasivan said the increase was due to large investment from the Netherlands in a 180.3 mln ringgit petrochemical project in Bintulu, national news agency Bernama reported.
