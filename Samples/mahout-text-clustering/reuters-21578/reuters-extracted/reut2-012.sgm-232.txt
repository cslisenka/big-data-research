POLL FINDS MOST THINK HOSTILE TAKEOVERS HARMFUL

Most Americans feel that hostile corporate takeovers do more harm than good, according to a public opinion poll by Louis Harris and Assoc Inc.     The poll of 1,751 U.S. adults and 682 top business executives found that 58 pct believe hostile takeovers do more harm than good, while only eight pct say they do more good than harm.     Among those holding stock, a 60 pct majority find takeovers harmful, the poll found. Shareholder benefit is the most commonly cited advantage of such takeovers.     "People are saying that (those engineering hostile takeovers) might talk about getting the stockholders a better break, but they are really not interested in that as much as they are realizing gains for themselves," concluded the poll, conducted for the University of North Carolina's Institute of Private Enterprise.     The poll said 78 pct believe most takeovers are engineered by groups interested only in making a profit for themselves and who don't care about the impact on employees or the economy as a whole.
