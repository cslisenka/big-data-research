LAC <LAC> BOOSTING EXPLORATION SPENDING

Lac Minerals Ltd's exploration spending will rise this year to 25 mln dlrs from 16.3 mln dlrs last year, the gold miner said in its annual report.     The 1987 budget involves 16 mln dlrs for advanced exploration on a tin project in New Brunswick, Bousquet mine number two in Quebec and the Ortiz property in New Mexico, and nine mln dlrs for pure exploration.     Total capital and exploration spending will rise this year to about 130 mln dlrs from 98 mln dlrs last year, with 77 mln dlrs of the 1987 amount set for the Page-Williams mine in Hemlo, Ontario, Lac said.     A decision is imminent on Lac's appeal of an Ontario court ruling last year ordering Lac to hand over Page-Williams to <International Corona Resources Ltd>.     Lac's total 1986 gold production rose to 478,394 ounces from 265,925 ounces the previous year. Production excluding Page-Williams eased last year to 245,232 ounces from 255,556 ounces in 1985.
