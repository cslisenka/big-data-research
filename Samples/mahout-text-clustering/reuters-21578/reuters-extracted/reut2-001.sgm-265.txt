AID <AIDC> PROPOSES NAME CHANGE

AID Corp said its stockholders will be asked to change the company's name to ALLIED Group Inc to more closely reflect the corporate logo adopted last year.     It said stockholders of record March 31 will be eligible to vote at the meeting.     The company said its board has approved an amendment to the pooling agreement effective January one, whereby <AMCO Insurance Co> will increase its participation by assuming 33 pct of ALLIED Group's combined written premiums. AMCO had previously assumed 30 pct of the combined written premiums.     With this amendment, AID said, its subsidiaries now assume 41 pct of the total combined written premiums.  Reuter &#3;
