SOUTHWEST FOREST <SWF> SETTLES STRIKE

Southwest Forest Industries said union workers at its Snowflake, Ariz., pulp and paper mill ratified a new three-year contract, ending a strike that halted production at the facility on March 17.     The new contract with the United Paperworkers International and International Brotherhood of Electrical workers provides for a wage and benefit increase of about three pct over three years and increased employee contributions to health care premiums, Southwest said.     The mill, which has an annual capacity of some 282,000 tons of newsprint and 159,000 tons of linerboard, is scheduled to resume production on March 26, the company also said.  Reuter &#3;
