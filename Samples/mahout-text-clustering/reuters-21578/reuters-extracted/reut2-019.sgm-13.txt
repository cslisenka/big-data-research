CANADA TO INCREASE CORPORATE TAX REVENUES

Canada will increase corporate tax revenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, finance minister Michael Wilson said.      As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations will bear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to lower overall tax rates.      Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.      "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income tax system that is competitive with other countries, particularly the United States," Wilson said in a prepared speech to the House of Commons.      "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," he added.      Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470 mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, according to documents tabled with Wilson's speech.
