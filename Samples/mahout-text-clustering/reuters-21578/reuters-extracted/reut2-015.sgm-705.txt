EUROPEAN AIRLINES REPORT RECORD PASSENGER RESULTS

European airlines, hit by a drop in business across the North Atlantic for much of last year, today reported record passenger traffic for February.     The 21-member Association of European Airlines said passenger traffic in February was 11 pct higher than a year earlier, allowing carriers to fill just under 60 pct of seat capacity, the highest ever recorded in the month.     On the North Atlantic route, where 1986 business suffered because American visitors were deterred by the falling dollar, fears of terrorism and the Chernobyl nuclear accident, passenger traffic was up 15.5 pct.     Improvements were also registered on South and Mid-Atlantic, European, Asian and Middle East routes.     "If the momentum is maintained AEA airlines can anticipate sustained growth this summer -- in marked contrast to last year," Henderson said in a statement.  Reuter &#3;
