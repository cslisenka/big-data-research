U.S. LIVESTOCK STRESSED BY COLD - USDA/NOAA

Snow and cold weather stressed livestock in the northern and Central plains and Rocky Mountain States in the week ended March 29, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In a summary of its weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said in Colorado, calving and lambing continued, but young animals were under stress.     Ranchers were busy digging out and locating stray livestock in Kansas and North Dakota, it said.     Heavy snowfall and cold gusty wind caused some cattle deaths in the Panhandle area of Oklahoma.     The cold weather slowed pasture growth from Texas to North Dakota, the agency said.     Pastures continued responding to moisture and warm temperatures in most other areas, it said.  Reuter &#3;
