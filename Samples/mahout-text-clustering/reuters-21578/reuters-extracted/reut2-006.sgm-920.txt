HOUSE VOTES TO RAISE NATIONAL SPEED LIMIT

The House of Representatives voted 217 to 206 to raise the national speed limit from 55 to 65 miles per hour on rural sections of interstate highways.     The legislation would give state governments the authority to raise the speed limit on about three-fourths of the 43,000 miles interstate system.     The Senate has already approved the speed limit increase as part of an 88 billion dlr federal highway and mass transit funding bill. The bill must go back to the Senate for final action. Congress set the 55 mile per hour limit in 1974 as an energy conservation and safety measure.  Reuter &#3;
