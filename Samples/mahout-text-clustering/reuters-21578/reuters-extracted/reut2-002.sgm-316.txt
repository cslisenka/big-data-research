PARADYNE <PDN> FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES

Paradyne Corp said a hearing is scheduled in the Federal District Court in Tampa today for criminal charges against it and eight of its present and former employees.     The charges pertain to the 1981 and 1982 Social Security Administration Equipment and Software Development Contracts.     Paradyne said it will issue announcements with respect to the 1985 indictments and other proceedings after today's hearings.     Miriam Frazer, a spokeswoman for Paradyne, said the major charge was for conspiracy to defraud the Social Security Administration in the procurement of a contract award to upgrade their computer network operation.     The contract is valued at about 80 mln dlrs and the equipment is currently installed and operating at the agency, Frazer said.     If found guilty, the sentence would likely be a fine for the company, and fines or imprisonment for the individuals, Frazer said.  Reuter &#3;
