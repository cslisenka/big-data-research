THORN-EMI WINS U.S. RULING IN BEATLES SUIT

<Thorn-EMI PLC> said the New York Supreme Court dismissed six of the nine actions in a suit filed by the Beatles for royalties on their songs.     It said the court dismissed charges of fraud and conversion, and claims of 50 mln dlrs in punitive damages sought by the companies, <Apple Records Inc>, <Apple Corps Ltd>, and former Beatles, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and the widow of John Lennon, Yoko Ono. Paul McCartney was not party to the suit.     The Beatles brought the suit against Capital Records Inc and EMI Records Ltd, two units of Thorn-EMI.     The Beatles charged the record companies with defrauding them by not paying royalties on sales of various recordings over the past 18 years.     A spokesman for the company in New York said while the court dismissed six of the nine actions involving punitive damages, three actions remain, with 30 mln dlrs in claims for royalties.
