IRAQ SAYS IRANIANS THROWN BACK IN SOUTH

Iraq said it had repelled an Iranian attack on positions held by its fourth army corps east of the southern Iraqi town of Amarah on the Baghdad-Basra highway.     A Baghdad war communique said an Iranian infantry brigade, backed by tanks, launched the overnight attack and fierce fighting raged for more than six hours before Iranian troops fled the battlefield, leaving 220 men killed and many wounded.     No major battles have been reported fought by the fourth army corps for more than a year in the area, mainly swamplands of the Hawizah marshes running eastward to the southern port city of Basra.
