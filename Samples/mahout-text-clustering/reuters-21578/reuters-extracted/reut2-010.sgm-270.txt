JAPAN DRAFT ECONOMIC PACKAGE DUE IN EARLY APRIL

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has told his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a draft economic package in early April in time for his visit to Washington starting on April 29, government officials said.     Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six industrial countries, the officials told Reuters.     The date for the government to announce its package, based on the LDP's suggested measures, is not yet known but it may be before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late May, the officials said.     The government has said in the past the package should come after the passage of the budget.     But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a planned five pct sales tax.     EPA chief Tetsuo Kondo told a press conference he sees a need to work on the economic plan early although the government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same, an EPA spokesman said.     Projected measures include promoting house construction, infrastructure and urban development, he quoted Kondo as saying.     Under last month's Paris currency agreement, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic plan to stimulate domestic demand, increase imports and so help reduce its huge trade surplus.     The government announced today Nakasone will visit Washington on April 29 for a week to discuss bilateral issues, including the trade imbalance, with President Reagan and other officials.
