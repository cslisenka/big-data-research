SHEARSON <SHE> TO BUYBACK UP TO 3 PCT OF STOCK

Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said it will repurchase up to three mln common shares or about three pct of its total common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.     The company said the recent decline in the market price of its shares presented an attractive investment opportunity and that the repurchase program would enhance shareholder value.     The shares will be repurchased in the open market from time to time based on market conditions, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
