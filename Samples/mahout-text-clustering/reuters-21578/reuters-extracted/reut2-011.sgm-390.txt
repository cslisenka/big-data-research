EUROPEAN COOPERATION ABSOLUTE MUST - PHILIPS

European countries must cooperate closely if they want to save their electronics industry from dropping to a third-rate global position, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PLGO.AS> chairman Cor van der Klugt told a congress here.     Noting that Europe was now a net importer of Integrated Circuits, Van der Klugt said that in information technology, the European Community had posted a trade deficit in 1984 of five billion ecus compared with a 1975 surplus of 1.7 billion ecus.     Such factors were forcing European electronics companies to seek cooperation with others both inside and outside Europe.     Van der Klugt cited Western Europe's joint high-technology research programme ESPRIT, sponsored by the European Community, as a useful programme for what he called "pre-competitive cooperation" with other companies in the same or related fields.     The Philips president said companies should join such efforts in an attempt to gain a foothold in markets of strategic importance such as the U.S. And Japan.     Working together, firms could produce on a larger scale and more cheaply by sharing business risks and pooling together development, marketing and production activities, he said.     As an example, Van der Klugt pointed to Philips' telecommunications joint venture with AT and T <T.N> of the U.S. To form <APT>, working on digital telephone exchange projects.     "Only the largest companies can recoup the billions of dollars involved in development in this area," he said, adding that the world market offered room for no more than seven or eight manufacturers of such products.
