UK CONSERVATIVES LEAD LABOUR BY SEVEN POINTS, POLL

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives lead the opposition Labour party by seven percentage points in the June 11 election campaign, according to a public opinion poll today.     The Harris poll on the TV-AM breakfast television show gave Thatcher's Conservative Party 42 pct, Labour 35 pct and the centrist Alliance 21 pct.     This was a one point drop for the Conservatives and one point rise for the Alliance since the same organisation's survey yesterday.     However, a Marplan poll in the Today newspaper had the Conservatives 11 points ahead. It gave them 44 pct, Labour 33 pct and the Alliance 21 pct.     All poll results since the campaign began have shown the Conservatives in the lead. An aggregate of recent surveys showed they held a nine to 10 point lead over Labour, enough for a comfortable election victory.  REUTER &#3;
