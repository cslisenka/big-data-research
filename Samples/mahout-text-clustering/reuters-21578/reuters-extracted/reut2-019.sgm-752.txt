MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE P.S. NEW HAMPSHIRE <PNH>

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 1.3 billion dlrs of debt of Public Service Company of New Hampshire.     Under review are B-1 first mortgage bonds, B-2 refunding mortgage bonds, B-3 third mortgage and secured pollution control revenue bonds, Caa debentures and preferred stock.     Moody's cited an uncertain ability to meet fixed-income obligations due to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's refusal to grant a low-power operating license because of inadequate evacuation plans. The firm depends on credit markets to fund obligations, due to a negative internal cash flow, it said.  Reuter &#3;
