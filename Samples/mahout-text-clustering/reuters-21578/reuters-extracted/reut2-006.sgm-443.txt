CZECHOSLOVAKIAN MILK POWDER BANNED BY UAE

The United Arab Emirates, UAE, has banned a Czechoslovakian milk powder because checks showed unacceptable radiation levels, government officials said.     They said stocks of the powdered milk are being withdrawn from the market following checks on food imported from Europe since last year's Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.     The UAE three weeks ago banned two brands of Austrian powdered milk for the same reasons.  Reuter &#3;
