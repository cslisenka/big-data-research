TREASURY'S BAKER SEES COORDINATION PROCESS

Treasury Secretary James Baker said  the finance ministers from the group of seven industrial countries have agreed on a new process for economic coordination. He declined to be specific.     Meeting with reporters to discuss the upcoming economic summit in Venice, Baker said the finance ministers will unveil the new process, a year in the development, to the heads of state at that meeting.     Baker said that in cooperation with the other countries, details will not be made public.     Baker said the United States hoped to get a new committment by the other industrial countries to reduce trade friction over agricultural products which he said was the major trade issue facing the global economy.     He said, however, that it was not expected that any specific new program would come from the meetings.  Reuter &#3;
