CBT CORN FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO FIRMER

CBT corn futures were expected to open steady to firmer, supported by a much larger than expected weekly corn export inspection figure yesterday, traders said.     Modest country movement will allow an initial advance. ----  Original holders of expired generic commodity certificates that expired from December 31, 1986, through March 31, 1987, may exchange the certificates for cash, the USDA said...The USDA reported U.S. soybean export inspections totalled 10,844,000 bushels in the week ended April 2, compared to 17,683,000 the previous week and 13,979,000 bushels in the year ago week, with wheat 16,363,000 bushels, 20,717,000 and 11,253,000 respectively and corn 46,652,000 bushels, 36,581,000 and 13,844,000 bushels respectively.
