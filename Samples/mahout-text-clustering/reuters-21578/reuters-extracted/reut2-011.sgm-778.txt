HAWKE DECIDES AGAINST EARLY AUSTRALIAN ELECTION

Prime Minister Bob Hawke has decided against an early election despite a leadership crisis in the opposition coalition, Australian government officials said.     They said Hawke made the decision after meeting senior advisers and high-ranking members of the ruling Labour Party in Canberra last night.     An expected improvement in the economy predicted by an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report was a major factor in Hawke's deciding against calling an election now, they said.     The officials picked March 5 next year as the most likely election date, which would allow the government to complete its full five-year term of office and ensure that Hawke becomes the longest-serving Labour Prime Minister in Australian history.     Hawke, however, has not withdrawn his earlier threat to consider dissolving both houses of parliament if the opposition National-Liberal Party coalition blocked legislation to introduce identity cards for Australians.
