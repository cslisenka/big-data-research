FOB U.S. GULF CORN VALUES SLIGHTLY FIRMER

FOB U.S. gulf corn values were slightly firmer as active gulf interest boosted gulf FOB and CIF values today, exporters said.     Loading programs and relatively slow country movement kept gulf interest lively. There were indications that 50,000 tonnes traded for August shipment at 20 cents over September, that 50,000 tonnes traded yesterday for June at 20-1/2 cents over July, and that 25,000 tonnes of number three corn traded yesterday off the Atlantic at 23 over May for May 1-20.     Hard wheat offers were firm amid tight pipeline supplies.     Dealers quoted the following afternoon FOB U.S. gulf values, basis Chicago futures, except hard red winter wheat basis Kansas City.
