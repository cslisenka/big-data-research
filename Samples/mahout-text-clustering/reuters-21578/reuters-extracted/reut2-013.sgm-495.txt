GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRMS ON TENDER

Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct, back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earlier today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new securities repurchase pact, dealers said.     The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct, unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.     Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in line with market rates for call money.     When this did not happen, because of more than adequate liquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from the market and use them to build up minimum reserves further.     This resulted in the slight rise in call money.     Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5, averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month, well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve requirement, dealers said.     There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was offering more funds above the call money rate.     But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility was in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 today after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.     Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to bid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billion marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact expires.     One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.     Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling to cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its faster and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might have been associated with the new system.     Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over the next month lower the call money range from the narrow 3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently.  REUTER &#3;
