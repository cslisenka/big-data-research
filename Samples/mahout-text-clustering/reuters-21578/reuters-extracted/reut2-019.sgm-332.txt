BROOKLYN UNION SAYS A RATE HIKE WOULD BE MODEST

Brooklyn Union Gas <BU>, a New York gas utility company, said it will try to limit any rate hikes to customers by arranging alternative supplies to replace the spot natural gas that Transco Energy Co <E> no longer delivers, a company official told Reuters.     Edward Sondey, vice president of supply, said that under a grandfather clause Brooklyn Union could request Transco to transmit 165 mln cubic feet (mcf) a day of spot natural gas after purchasing 250 mcf of contract gas from Transco.     Brooklyn Union has been taking only 30 pct, or 75 mcf, of the contract gas from Transco, and acquiring about 120 mcf on the spot, or non-contract, market, he said.     Lacking access to spot gas through Transco would not cost Brooklyn Union more than 50 cts per mln btu for now, Sondey said, as Transco contract gas costs 2.55 dlrs per mln compared to about two dlrs for spot gas.     "The rate increase will not be serious," Sondey said.     The contract price at 2.55 dlrs per mln BTU has been effective since May 1 after Transco lowered its commodity rate to reflect seasonal weakness, making it the lowest in the 12 months ended May 31, according to report submitted by Brooklyn Union to New York Public Utility Commission.     In peak demand season, Transco's contract gas reached as high as 4.30 to 4.40 dlrs per mln btu, a commission official said.     Industry analysts expected little adverse effect from interrupted spot supplies on Brooklyn Union's earnings for its current fiscal year ending September 30.     But if the open access problem to Transco is not resolved this winter, high cost of contract gas could cut into the company's profit, they said.  Reuter &#3;
