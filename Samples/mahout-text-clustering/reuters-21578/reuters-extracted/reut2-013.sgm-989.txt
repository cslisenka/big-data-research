CBT CORN FUTURES TRADE QUIETLY MIXED EARLY

CBT corn futures traded firmer early, holding gains of 1-1/4 cents to 3/4 cent per bushel in moderately light early trade.     Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to about three times last year's weekly inspections, plus the outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline in the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.     Cargill, the Illinois Co-op, Refco and ADM were the featured buyers of old crop May, with CIS a buyer in new crop December, pit brokers said.  Reuter &#3;
