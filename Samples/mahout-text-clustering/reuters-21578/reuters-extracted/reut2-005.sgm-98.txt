U.S. ACTION AGAINST EC MEAT PLAN URGED IN HOUSE

The entire House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry has written U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter a letter urging the Reagan administration to block a European Community, EC, plan to tighten meat inspection requirements.     The letter signed by the 16 panel members said the EC plan to require U.S. meat processing plants to comply with EC standards would "impose an unnecessary and unfair hardship on the U.S. meat industry."     The EC plan is set to go into effect April 30.     "It would be inconceivable that we would allow the EC continued access to the U.S. market while they attempt to halt our meat exports to the EC," the March 9 letter said.  Reuter &#3;
