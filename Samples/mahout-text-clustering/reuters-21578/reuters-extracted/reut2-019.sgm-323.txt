SAINSBURY <SBRY.L> LONG-TERM DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed the AA long-term debt of J. Sainsbury PLC.     S and P cited Sainsbury's offer for the shares of Shaws Supermarkets Inc's <SHAW> it does not own. Sainsbury currently holds 28.5 pct of that company.     The acquisition will be financed by an equity issue, so the impact on Sainsbury's capital structure will not be significant, the agency said. The merger will provide an opportunity for expansion in an area with favorable economic trends, although it will lower trading margins by more than Sainsbury's historic levels, S and P pointed out.
