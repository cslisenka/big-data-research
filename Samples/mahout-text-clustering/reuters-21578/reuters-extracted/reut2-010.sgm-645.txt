S. AFRICAN MINISTER DEAD

South Africa's Environmental Affairs Minister John Wiley died today in an apparent suicide attempt, police said.     His wife found him lying on his bed at home this morning with a bullet wound in his head, police said. A pistol lay by his side.     The police said no crime was suspected and they were treating it as an apparent suicide.     The spokesman said Wiley's wife returned to the family home near Cape Town to find the door locked. She found help to break into the house and found her husband dead.     Wiley, 60, had been member of parliament for Simonstown, near Cape Town, since 1966, representing several parties.     Local reporters said he had been fighting a very active campaign to retain the seat for the National Party (NP) in the May 6 whites-only general election.     They said he won the seat comfortably for the NP in the 1981 poll, but was facing a strong challenge this year from John Scott, candidate for the centrist Progressive Federal Party.  REUTER &#3;
