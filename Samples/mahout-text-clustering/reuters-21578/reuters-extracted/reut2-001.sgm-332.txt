WRITERS GUILD TO MEET WITH NETWORKS THURSDAY

The Writers Guild of America said it agreed to meet with representatives of CBS Inc <CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc <CCB> at the offices of the Federal Mediation Service at 1000 EST Thursday.     "The guild is pleased that the networks have returned to the table," a spokesman said. The talks would be the first since the guild struck radio and television networks and some local broadcast operations of the two companies at 0600 EDT March two.     A contract covering more than 500 writers, editors and other personnel expired early March two.  Reuter &#3;
