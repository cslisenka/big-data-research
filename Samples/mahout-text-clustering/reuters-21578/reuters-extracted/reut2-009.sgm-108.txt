TANDON <TCOR> SAYS SEARS <S> STILL CUSTOMER

Tandon Corp said Sears Roebuck, through its Sears Business Centers, continues to be a customer of Tandon for its products.     The company said it was issuing the statement in response to a published report that quoted unidentified industry sources as saying Sears Business Centers will shortly discontinue carrying Tandon computer products.     Tandon noted, however, that while the Sears relationship is important, in the first quarter of 1987, ended December 28, 1986, sales to Sears accounted for less than two pct of the company's total revenues of 76.44 mln dlrs.
