SENATE PANEL APPROVES EXTENDING DAIRY COMMISSION

The Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would extend for one year the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy.     The dairy commission, mandated by the 1985 farm bill, is set to expire at the end of the month. The bill would extend the date by which the commission must submit its report on dairy policy to March 31, 1988.     Congress charged the commission with examining the federal price support program for milk and alternatives to the program.  Reuter &#3;
