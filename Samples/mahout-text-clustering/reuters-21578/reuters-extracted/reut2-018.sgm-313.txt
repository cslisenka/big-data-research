BELL ATLANTIC <BEL> FILES FOR NEW YORK SERVICE

Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems said it filed with the New York Public Service Commission proposed retail rates to market mobile telephone services in the metropolitan New York City area.     The company expects the rates to go into effect July 1, after a 60-day statutory period, pending regulatory approval.     It said the approved price structure is the last regulatory step before the company begins marketing cellular service and equipment in northern New Jersey.   Reuter &#3;
