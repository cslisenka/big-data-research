NIGERIA PUTS DOMESTIC OIL SUBSIDY AT 85 PCT

NIGERIAN OIL MINISTER RILWANU LUKMAN SAID TODAY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY ON DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTS HAD RISEN FROM 20 TO 85 PCT AFTER THE FLOTATION OF THE NAIRA CURRENCY LAST SEPTEMBER.     THE NAIRA HAS DEPRECIATED BY OVER 60 PCT AGAINST THE DOLLAR SINCE IT WAS FLOATED AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS PETROLEUM PRODUCTS HAD BECOME TOO CHEAP ENCOURAGING SMUGGLING TO NEIGHBOURING STATES.     LUKMAN TOLD REPORTERS DOMESTIC OIL PRICES WERE BEING CRITICALLY STUDIED AND A DECISION WOULD BE TAKEN SOON ON WHETHER OR NOT TO REDUCE THE SUBSIDY.     LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT CUT OIL SUBSIDY BY 80 PCT AS PART OF ITS ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM.     OIL FIRMS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE DEPRECIATION OF THE NAIRA HAS MADE FURTHER REMOVAL OF PETROLEUM SUBSIDY NECESSARY.  Reuter &#3;
