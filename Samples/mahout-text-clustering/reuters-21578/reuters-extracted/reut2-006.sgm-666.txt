Unisys Corp said shipments will begin in July 1987 of its new security software package to prevent unauthorized access to its A series mainframe computers used by commercial customers and for government installations.     The Infoguard software security module extends the security facilities already available on A series computers, it said.     Infoguard may be licensed through a five year extended term purchase or on a monthly license basis.  The five year ETP ranges from 8,450 dlrs on an A 2 mainframe to 34,300 dlrs on an A 15 mainframe, it said.  Reuter &#3;
