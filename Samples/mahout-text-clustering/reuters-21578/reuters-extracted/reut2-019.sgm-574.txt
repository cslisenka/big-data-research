OLIVETTI SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN RADIOCOR BUSINESS

Ing C Olivetti EC SpA <OLIV.MI> is in contact with Telerate Inc <TLR> of the U.S. And other, unidentifed groups with a view to strengthening its economic news agency business <Radiocor - Agenzia Giornalistica Economica Finanziaria SRL>, an Olivetti spokesman said.     The spokesman was responding to a Reuters query following an item in the Milan weekly Milano Finanza saying Dow Jones and Co Inc <DJ>, which has a controlling stake in Telerate, could become a partner in Radiocor through subscribing to a capital increase.      The spokesman said that Telerate was among many companies with which Olivetti was in contact, with a view to strengthening Radiocor through the entry into the business of new partners, but that no accord had been reached.     He declined to identify the other companies involved, but Milano Finanza named the owners of the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24-Ore and <Societa Elenchi Ufficiali degli Abbonati al Telefono> as likely partners along with Telerate.      Olivetti last month announced a joint information technology deal with Societa Elenchi, which specialises in publishing telephone and city directories, and the Italian publishing group <L'Espresso>.     Olivetti chairman Carlo De Benedetti told the Olivetti annual meeting last week that the entry of new partners into Radiocor was planned, but he did not elaborate.     Industry sources said they believed talks between Olivetti and Telerate had been taking place for some months.      Olivetti acquired a 76 pct stake in Radiocor last December and has since increased its stake in the agency to 100 pct.     The takeover was followed in May this year by the acquisiton by De Benedetti's French holding company <Cerus> of a stake of around 35 pct in the French financial information agency <Dafsa>.     In May, Cerus also acquired a 4.9 pct stake in the British publishing and financial services group Pearson Plc <PSON.L>.   REUTER &#3;
