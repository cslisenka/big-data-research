DIGITAL COMM <DCAI> WINS FAVORABLE RULING

Digital Communications Associates Inc said the U.S. District Court issued a ruling prohibiting <Softklone Distributing Corp> from selling a software product that Digital claimed violates one of its copyrights.     The company said no damages were set in the court's ruling.     "The court has validated our contention that the user interface and the appearnace of a product is a vital element of the product and is protectable by U.S. copyright law," the company said.     Digital said the ruling involved a copyright infringement suit filed against Softklone by Microstuf Inc, which Digital acquired in October 1986.     The suit charged that Softklone's Mirror software product violated the copyright of Microstuf's CrossTalk program, Digital said.  Reuter &#3;
