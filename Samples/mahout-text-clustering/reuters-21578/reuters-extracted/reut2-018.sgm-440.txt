DUTCH RETAILER VENDEX DELAYS FLOTATION UNTIL 1990

Dutch retail and services group Vendex International <VENN.AS> has delayed its flotation from 1988 to 1990, chairman and major shareholder Anton Dreesmann said in an interview with a Dutch financial daily.     "We don't need a flotation yet," he told the Financieele Dagblad, noting he wanted net profit to rise to 400 mln guilders from last year's 302 mln before moving to the bourse.     Dreesmann added the flotation might be speeded up if the company should need a substantial amount of capital for an attractive major takeover, but he had no prospects yet. Vendex plans to pay at least 30 pct of profits in dividends.  REUTER &#3;
