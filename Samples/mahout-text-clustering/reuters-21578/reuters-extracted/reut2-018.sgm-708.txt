HACHETTE SEES SHARP PROFIT INCREASE IN 1987

French media and publishing group Hachette <HACP.PA> expects a record 15 pct rise in its profits this year, Hachette chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere said.     Lagardere told a news conference that Hachette's profits last year were 565.4 mln francs against 431.7 mln in 1985.      He said that Hachette was carrying out feasibility studies for the launching around October next year of a nationwide daily newspaper. Earlier this year it made an unsuccessful three billion franc bid for state-owned television network TF-1.     In a letter sent to shareholders, Lagardere said that 1987 was likely to be another record year for the company.     Hachette owns the Europe-1 radio station, about 60 weekly newspapers and magazines, and is also involved in printing.     It posted a 14.7 billion franc consolidated turnover last year against 11.6 billion in 1985.   REUTER &#3;
