SWISSAIR FINDS CRACKS IN DC-10S

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> has found cracks in the tails of two of its own DC-10 aircraft made by McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD.N> and a third belonging to the Dutch airline KLM Royal Dutch Airlines <KLM.AS>, a Swissair spokesman said.     A Swissair spokesman said the cracks, in the horizontal tail surface, came to light during routine maintenance of the Dutch aircraft here on March 18.     Subsequent checks on Swissair's 11 DC-10s showed similar problems, thought to be due to material fatigue, he said.     The spokesman said the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and McDonnell Douglas have ordered checks of all 400 DC-10s in use by airlines worldwide.     Swissair said both the FAA and Swiss aviation authorities had allowed it to continue to fly its DC-10s on condition the damage was repaired and planes were checked after each landing.     Several days ago, Swissair announced a firm order for six McDonnell Douglas's MD-11s, with an option for 12 more, to replace its DC-10s. The MD-11 is a development of the DC-10.  REUTER &#3;
