PFIZER <PFE> STUDIES DRUG AS WEIGHT LOSS TOOL

Pfizer Inc said it expects to file a new drug application in the U.S. and in other markets this year for sertraline, a treatment for depression.     In its annual report, Pfizer said that in addition to the drug's anti-depressant action, sertraline is currently undergoing studies to explore its ability to promote weight loss. Company officials were not immediately available to comment further.     Eli Lilly and Co's <LLY> Prozac, an antidepressant awaiting marketing approval, has shown promise in promoting weight loss.     Pfizer also said it plans to file for U.S. marketing approval for certrizine, a "novel" antihistamine for hay fever, and other allergic reactions.     In 1986, Pfizer earned 660 mln dlrs or 3.90 dlrs per share on revenues of 4.5 billion dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
