BOTSWANA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT AID

President Quett Masire appealed for international aid to combat the effects of a drought ravaging land-locked Botswana for the sixth consecutive year.     Speaking on state radio, Masire said the drought had decimated herds of cattle and wiped out crops throughout the mainly desert country, which would be forced to rely on South Africa for most of its food supplies in the coming year.     Masire said the government would also be forced to continue a drought relief program until at least the end of 1988 to provide emergency water supplies and supplementary food to vulnerable sections of the population.     "It is against this background that we appeal to the international community for assistance," Masire said.     He thanked foreign governments for previous assistance, but added, "The needs of the people in rural areas are greater now, not less. We must prevent the human suffering caused by malnutrition."
