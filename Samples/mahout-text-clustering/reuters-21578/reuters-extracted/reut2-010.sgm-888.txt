Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 2.2 billion crowns of debt of <Gotabanken> and its unit, Gotabanken Inc.     The rating agency cited concerns over the company's asset quality. Gotabanken was Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank in 1985 based on consolidated assets of 45.4 billion crowns.     Under review for possible downgrade are Gotabanken's Prime-1 short-term deposits and the unit's same-rated commercial paper.  Reuter &#3;
