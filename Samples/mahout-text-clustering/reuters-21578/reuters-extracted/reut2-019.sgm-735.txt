NATIONAL PATENT <NPD> TO START AIDS DRUG TRIAL

National Patent Development Corp and Bar-Ilan University of Israel said that their joint venture corporation, Scientific Testing Inc, will begin a clinical trial in the U.S. of its immuno-augmenting compound, AS101, for the treatment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).     The study will be conducted at the Institute of Immunological Disorders (MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, Tex) under the direction of Dr Peter Mensell, pursuant to an investigational new drug application filed with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said.     The study, expected to begin in four to six weeks, is designed to test the effects of AS101 on about 30 AIDS patients, National Patent said.     It added that AS101, a proprietary synthetic compound invented by Bar-Ilan University doctors, has shown immuno-augmenting, anti-viral and anti-tumor activity in preclinical animal testing, and immuno-augmenting activity in a limited number of AIDS patients in phase one foreign clinical tests.
