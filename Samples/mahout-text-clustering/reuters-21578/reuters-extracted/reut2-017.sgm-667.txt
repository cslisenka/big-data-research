KOHL COALITION ACCEPTS DOUBLE-ZERO

West Germany said it would accept a superpower plan to ban medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles in Europe provided Bonn was allowed to retain its own shorter-range missiles.     After six weeks of public wrangling over the so-called "double-zero" offer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition finally said it would agree to an East-West ban on shorter-range nuclear missiles.     But in a statement issued after top-level talks, the government said Bonn wanted the 72 West German Pershing-1a missiles excluded from an East-West accord -- a demand diplomats said could produce a snag in the Geneva arms talks.
