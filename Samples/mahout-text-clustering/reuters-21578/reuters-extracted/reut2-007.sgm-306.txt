PANHANDLE <PEL> LINES EXTEND TRANSPORT SERVICE

Panhanele Eastern Corp said its two interstate pipeline subsidiaries will extend the availability of self-implementing transportation service beyond the scheduled May one termination of the program set by federal regulators.     The company explained that Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co and Trunkline Gas Co are engaged in renegotiating their basic utility service agreements to provide both traditional tariff sales and transportation service. Because this process requires considerable time, the continuity of transport service is being preserved, it added.  Reuter &#3;
