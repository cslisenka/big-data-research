Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets east of the south Lebanese port town of Sidon, in the first such attack this month, local radio stations said.     They said the planes attacked Palestinian targets in the Darb al-Sim area, a few km (miles) east of Sidon, and smoke was seen billowing over the area.     Details were not immediately available.
