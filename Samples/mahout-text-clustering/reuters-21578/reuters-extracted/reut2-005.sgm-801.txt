SYRIA PROPOSES REDUCED BUDGET FOR 1987

The government proposed a 1987 budget of up to 41.7 billion Syrian pounds, a 4.8 pct decrease from last year's allocation.     Finance minister Qahtan Seyoufi told parliament last night the reduction was due mainly to a cut in investment allocations.     Planned recurrent spending of 24.2 billion pounds, almost unchanged from 1986, took account of national security needs and "Syria's role in steadfastness and liberation," he said.     The budget, which is still subject to approval by parliament and by President Hafez al-Assad, also aims to meet mounting spending on education, health and essential imports.     Power and water projects would take up 43.5 pct of investment allocations of 17.5 billion pounds and agriculture about 20 pct, Seyoufi said.     The budget's basic goals were to restrict current spending, curb inflation and step up reliance on local resources, he said.  REUTER &#3;
