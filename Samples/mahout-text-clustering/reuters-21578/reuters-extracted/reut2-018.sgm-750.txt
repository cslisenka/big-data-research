BECOR WESTERN <BCW>AGAIN ADJOURNS HOLDER MEETING

Becor Western Inc said its reconvened shareholders meeting has been adjourned to 1000 CDT June 30.     The company had previously announced plans to again adjourn the meeting following receipt of a renewed offer from Lynch Corp <LGL> yesterday.     The meeting was originally convened on June four when shareholders approved the sale of Becor's Western Gear Corp subsidiary before adjourning. The remaining matter to be presented is the proposed acquisition of Becor by BCW Acquisition Inc, now one of four offers for the company./  Reuter &#3;
